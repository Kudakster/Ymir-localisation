#idea_academ#1
A place of higher knowledges

#idea_academ_1#1
For the prosperity and cultural excellence of our people, we could create a place of knowledge and wisdom, with our most sagacious pigs working to furtger our knowledges of the world.

#idea_agrcultr#1
Not enough food from gathering!

#idea_agrcultr_1#1
Our people is starving! Our hunters and gatherers do not manage to bring enough food for everyone anymore, and we quickly need to find a solution if we want the tribe to keep prospering. Urged by this situation, a young gatherer came forward and proposed something mind shattering to the elders of the tribe : why not make our own plants ? 

#idea_agrcultr_2#1
He explained how a few weeks ago, one of his piglets dropped a basket full of precious grain harvested in the morning in muddy soil near his hut, and how they could only recover some of it. He brought them to the same patch of mud, from which now stood a few fresh and green plants bearing the same grain. "If we cannot find enough plants to feed everyone anymore, then let us make our own!" he said. 

#idea_agrcultr2#1
Food stagnation

#idea_agrcultr2_1#1
Our people is stagnating: there is a limit to how much food we can harvest from the wilderness. Our tribe grew strong, but all the animals and all the edible plants in the territory are already exploited! That is until one old gatherer came forward and proposed something mind shattering to the elders of the tribe : why not make our own plants ?

#idea_agrcultr2_2#1
He told a story of how in his youth one of his piglets had once dropped a basket full of precious grain harvested in the morning in muddy soil near his hut, and how they had only been able to recover some of it. Weeks later he had noticed how new fresh green plants bearing the same grains had emerged: amazed, he shared his discovery with other gatherers but was only met with indifference. Who needed that anyway ? For there was enough food freely available at hand and no need to bother with extra work. Maybe now is the time to show interest in his ideas, so our tribe can keep growing bigger ?

#idea_alambic#1
Distillation

#idea_alambic_1#1
When you heat and boil water for a long time, it disapears into fumes. When an alcoholic bevarage is heated, it seems that its intoxicating fumes are the strongest at first and leave a tasteless drink behind. What if we could design a device that could collect these first fumes back to separate what makes these drinks so intoxicating from the tasteless water? Some think it could be possible by trapping and cooling the fumes which would turn back into a liquid.

#idea_algebr#1
A language for numbers

#idea_algebr_1#1
We need a language for numbers, a standardized system of symbols with rules that represent operations and calculations.

#idea_animcaptr#1
Keeping livestocks

#idea_animcaptr_1#1
Sometimes, hunters manage to capture preys unharmed, or they find youngsters that remained alone. Other times, some herbivor animals come wandering near the village seemingly indifferent to our presence. What if we built walls around them to keep them near the village for times of need? This way if the hunters fail to catch anything, we can still have fresh meat for the tribe! We would need to learn how to take care of them through the rest of the year though, and some tribe member would need to guard them into pastures to feed. But it would give us the safety of always having fresh food available for our people in case of shortage!

#idea_animdom#1
Making new animals

#idea_animdom_1#1
In the wilderness herds grow bigger every year and there is always new animals to hunt! How does that happen ? We know how to take care of the few beasts we captured and keep in paddocks for times of need. But what if we found a way to manage and breed them efficiently like they do in the wilderness? We could produce our own animals without needing to hunt them! But could we manage bigger herds of animals? Feeding them, garding them, managing their breeding and giving birth...

#idea_animhusb#1
Selective breeding

#idea_animhusb_1#1
Not all animals of the same species look the same: some are smaller, others are more friendly, or agressive, or tougher, or faster... What if we decided to only breed the animals with these individual traits we want? Maybe their offspring would share the same traits and we could improve our cattle this way, developping animals specialized into serving our needs and friendlier to us.

#idea_archbdg#1
Self-supporting structures

#idea_archbdg_1#1
Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of stone to counteract the effects of gravity, but what if we could master a way to create new arches so light they could stand on simple columns by redirecting weight into its supporting pillars ? We could construct things bigger, taller and more spacious than anything we've ever built before.

#idea_archery#1
Throwing arrows

#idea_archery_1#1
Some wood show exceptionnal flexibility and ability to store tension without breaking. What if we could find a way to project them simply by releasing a bent piece of wood, stronger than any arm can? 

#idea_archives#1
Paper hoarding

#idea_archives_1#1
Keeping existing and past documents organized and archived can sometimes greatly benefit the efficiency of our administration. We should invest in a governmental archive specialized in organizing and keeping all our administrative documents.

#idea_archtct#1
The science of building

#idea_archtct_1#1
Complex construction require the expertise and skill of sagacious pigs knowledgable in the sciences of numbers and geometry, and not just leave it to mere builders who know how to manipulate a hammer. They could use these sciences to predict and build things noone deems possible, and to research new methods and techniques for the glory of our people. We would call them Architects.

#idea_ard#1
A hoe pulled by animals

#idea_ard_1#1
Instead of manually working the fields with hoes, what if we devised a way to use animals to pull a bigger one that would break the soil in lines for us, making it ready for the seeds. With such technique we could work much bigger fields and greatly improve the efficiency of farms.

#idea_aritmet#1
Combining numbers

#idea_aritmet_1#1
We could manage amounts more easily by devising a system to organize numbers and how to combine them.

#idea_barrel#1
Wooden amphoras

#idea_barrel_1#1
We if by assembling planks together to form a large cylindric container held together with metal, we made a new kind of containers to store liquids? They could use limited space more efficiently for transportation and while a broken amphora is useless, such a wooden container could always be repaired. They could even be dismantled on when empty to be rebuilt on demand! Yes they would be more expensive and require more work and skill to build, but some say they could improve alcoholic beverages preservation while adding new flavors to it.

#idea_barter#1
No more free meals!

#idea_barter_1#1
We could start exchanging goods of equivalent values for each service on the instant instead of sharing everything with anyone of the community hoping for later paybacks which becomes harder to track as the population increases: a gift economy can only be viable as long as all members of the community can build trust by knowing and remembering each other. Beyond that it creates much conflict and instability which could be reduced by transitionning to a system of immediate equivalent exchange.

#idea_baskpress#1
Screw in barrels

#idea_baskpress_1#1
With the power of screws and the knowledge of how to craft solid barrels, we would surely improve our pressing machines by having the fruits placed in a barrel with enough space between each plank to let the juices out as a plate if forced down into it by the force of a screw! This would increasing greatly their efficiency and require less workforce for the same amount of work.

#idea_baths#1
Communal washing

#idea_baths_1#1
Bathing is such a relaxing activity, but its gets boring alone in your home or inconvenient oustide in the river... What if we made facilities specialized in bathing where Porcos of the city could come to relax in bigger pools of warm water while socializing and enjoying entertainments at the same time? 

#idea_battleaxe#1
Cutting bacon

#idea_battleaxe_1#1
If axes are good enough to cut trees, they're good enough to cut bacon. We could create special axes designed for combat by making them lighter and longer, with narrower crescent shaped blades to deal high damage! Such a weapon would however require to be manipulated with both hands, but effective even against armored enemies.

#idea_beamprss#1
Pressing with a lever

#idea_beamprss_1#1
Using the new principle of the lever, we could apply it to improve the way we press hard olives into oil by have a long level apply pressure on a plate while olives are kept in a soft basket of ropes. A few workers could apply great pressure from the other end of the lever, making the process much faster than by using mortars and increasing the production speed of olive oil.

#idea_beastwr#1
The way of the beasts

#idea_beastwr_1#1
Some wild animals are fierce and noble. Their hunting ways deserve respect and admiration of our warriors. The spirits of these magestic beasts could infuse strenght in our best porcos to form an elite cast of warriors that would instill fear onto our enemies.

#idea_beer#1
Beer speaks, people mumble

#idea_beer_1#1
Grain left to ferment in water for a long time makes a thick nourishing drink that makes people feel nice and festive. Isnt this a gift from the gods? Some porcos want to specialize in working full time into making this special drink for everyone to enjoy!

#idea_blastfurn#1
Bigger bloomeries

#idea_blastfurn_1#1
Building taller and bigger bloomeries while using belows to blow more air directly into its base would allow us to keep improving our furnaces, making them reach much higher temperatures to produce better quality metals and a faster rate. 

#idea_bllws#1
Blowing air

#idea_bllws_1#1
The more air, the hotter the furnace gets: instead of relying on natural air flow, we could try to make a device that manually blows air directly into the heart of the furnace, by pressing on a bag filled with air into a pipe which would help us increase further more the temperature and efficiency of our metal working.

#idea_bloomry#1
Improving furnaces

#idea_bloomry_1#1
Heating rocks to extract and melt metals is key to process ores quicker and get a better quality result with less impurities. Everyone knows blowing air on fire brings it life and heat. We need to improve our furnaces design to build bigger ones, reusable, with solid materials while finding a way to provide its fire with fresh air which could allow us to reach higher temperatures and make metals more efficiently!

#idea_bread#1
Bread for everyone

#idea_bread_1#1
In every household, people spend a lot of time every day grinding their grains in mortars to cook their flat breads for each meal. Therefore some propose that by using our knowledges of gears and stonecutting we could create giant mortars that would grind grains for everyone at once and have artisans specialize in cooking breads for everyone in the city directly, saving people from making it themselves out of raw cereals. Grinded grains would also be easier and more convenient to store directly into granaries, improving our ability to store food!

#idea_brigdn#1
A coat of plates

#idea_brigdn_1#1
Scale armors are vulnerable to piercing attacks and upward blows. Despite a slight loss of flexibility, what if instead of having visible scales on top of each other we designed an armor where the scales are sewn indepently to a padded leather cloth and covered by another layer of fabric to hide them, making the whole more resistant to piercing thanks to the leather and the impossibility to slip the point of a weaping through gaps between scales?

#idea_bronze#1
Mixing metals

#idea_bronze_1#1
Now that we know how to make metals as liquid as water, what would happen if we mixed some together? Maybe we could create some new metals that never exist in nature with better properties? Copper is abundant and usefull, but it is soft and it wears quickly. Maybe we should experiment mixing it with other metals to see if we can improve this?

#idea_builders#1
Construction specialists

#idea_builders_1#1
Building things is getting complex and hard, requiring more and more skills. Having people specialized in construction would allow us to build better things and develop more advanced techniques.

#idea_calculus#1
Linking geometry and algebra

#idea_calculus_1#1
Algebra and Geometry have been coexisting for ever, but are not well linked. We have no way of harnessing the analytical power of algebra to describe geometry. 

#idea_calculus_2#1
But one of our Academicians, Ren� Despigs, had this revolutionnary idea: what if we connected them both by describing positions on a plane using a pair of numbers associated with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis? By describing the horizontal measurement with x's and the vertical measurement with y's, we could give geometric objects such as lines and circles representation as algebraic equations.

#idea_carpet#1
Floor covering textiles

#idea_carpet_1#1
Wool is so warm and comfy, why not make simple textiles made out of it to cover the floors and walls of our huts with? It would make for nice and warm new furniture everyone would like to have in his home!

#idea_castnet#1
Fishing without a net is just bathing

#idea_castnet_1#1
Instead of throwing sticks at fishes, why not weave loose flexible baskets we could throw in the water ? The water would pass through while the bigger fishes would remain stuck in it! We need to master this new skill and find the proper way and materials to weave these special baskets... it would make catching fishes much easier and less time consumming!

#idea_cattleliers#1
Horseback management

#idea_cattleliers_1#1
Cattle can spread over large areas and herds can become pretty difficult to manage. Higher up on horseback, it would be more convenient to move around and keep an eye on the herds than walking on foot below! Horses could become the essential companion to cattle raisers, making it easier to pursue and lead larger herds and managing bigger pastures. They would just need to get used to it...

#idea_cementation#1

#idea_charcoal#1
A new combustible

#idea_charcoal_1#1
Sometimes when burning wood, after a large fire, some pieces of wood burn but didnt turn into ashes. They look grey and porous, and after trying to light a new fire with them they appear to burn even hotter than normal wood while producing little smoke and are easier to light. If we could figure out exactly how to make these out of wood, we could use them in our pottery kilns and other industries instead of wood, increasing their efficiency!

#idea_chnmail#1
Unpiercable coat

#idea_chnmail_1#1
All armors remain weak against piercing blows: the finest weaponsmiths propose to craft a fine cloth of tiny metal rings which, linked together, would form an unpiercable coat that could be worn beneath other armors to protect against arrows and thrusting attacks. Such an armor would be expensive and really time consuming, requiring the best craftsmanship and metal, probably reserved to elite troops.

#idea_cider#1
Son Ar Jistr

#idea_cider_1#1
Apples are a nutricious source of food in nordic rainy lands where the nights come early during winters. It can also make for a tasty juice once pressed. But some porcos have started to let it spoil for days before drinking it, claiming it tastes even better and lifts the spirits. If we can master the skill of brewing this new beverage, we could create a new craftsmanship specialized in producing it.

#idea_cloth#1
Couvrez ce sein que je ne saurais voir!

#idea_cloth_1#1
Walking around with our bare piggy skins is not always very comfortable, especially in colder days. The sight of the Sow's multiple udders also seems to distract some of the tribespigs from their daily tasks...

#idea_coing#1
Seal of approval

#idea_coing_1#1
The government could apply its seal on metal ingots used by people in trades, to guarantee their quality and create units of standardized weights. That would facilitate exchanges and increase the people's trust in the currencies they're getting in exchange of their goods while giving us full control over the management of these special "coin" ingots.

#idea_coke#1
A mineral charcoal

#idea_coke_1#1
In the same way we make charcoal out of wood, in the ground we found coal: an oily dark kind of stone that, if baked it in a similar fashion turns into coke which can be used as a combustible in the same way we use charcoal. Mastering this process would allow us to get combustible without the need to cut down entire forests!

#idea_compbow#1
Mounted archery

#idea_compbow_1#1
What if soldiers could shoot arrows on horseback? They would be able to move while firing their bow thus remaining out of reach from infantry and at the same being harder to hit by enemy archers. It would be a formidable weapon. Unfortunately current bow are impractical to use while riding horses: we would need a much shorter yet powerful enough bow that riders could, with a lot of training, learn to use efficiently.

#idea_concrete#1
Liquid stone

#idea_concrete_1#1
What if we had the power to create stone and shape it as we wish? A liquid plaster that would dry and become harder as stone itself while also resisting water istelf and withstanding the harshness of weather? Such amazing material would allow us to build new things never dreamt before! Some pretend that by mixing lime, gravels and ceramics with a special kind of sand, we could achieve such mixture. Surely this is worth investigating ?

#idea_constrct#1
Organizing constructions

#idea_constrct_1#1
Even skilled builders need someone to coordinate them and take time to plan, organize and manage the construction instead of directly participating. Especially when it comes to building more complex things. These construction foremen would improve our ability to manage more complex construction projects.

#idea_constrplan#1
Working together

#idea_constrplan_1#1
No longer can we keep build randomly individual buildings without any global planning. Construction foremen and the government could work together to build and organize things necessary for the whole community, such as solid roads of stone to make circulation easier in the city, fences, or even modifying the elevation of terrain!

#idea_corbarch#1
Improving load-bearing

#idea_corbarch_1#1
The post and lintel construction technique has its limits: there's only so much weight a beam can withstand before breaking. What if we could redirect weight on the sides to improve this, by stacking beams of increasing lenght on top of each other until the cover the space between the pillars ?

#idea_council#1
Taking advices

#idea_council_1#1
We are no longer a small tribe: our society has grown more and more complex, with more people and more things to manage and maintain... A single leader can no longer attend to all the matters that require his attention and formally delegating governance to trusted advisors becomes a growing necessity to keep up with the all the required administration.

#idea_court#1
Keeping subordinates close

#idea_court_1#1
How do we improve the loyalty of our vassals and at the same time our ability to control them? We could use the carrot rather than the stick, and invite them all to stay live in extravagant luxruy in the palace of our own capital. They will be pacified by this hedonistic life, and at the same time their proximity will make the administration of subordinates considerably easier. But this will come at a great cost for this to work. We have shower them in so much luxury that they will not think again of returning to their homes.

#idea_crossbow#1
Mechanical bows

#idea_crossbow_1#1
As our knowledges of mechanics improve, curious engineers are exploring the idea of using this knowledge to build a mechanical bow: one that could amplify the strength of a soldier's arm with the power of gears and levers to draw a much more powerful bow and hold it effortlessly. Such weaponry would require less practice and training to master it, allowing for its use by less experienced soldiers.

#idea_cuirass#1
Wearing plates of hard metal

#idea_cuirass_1#1
A warrior with a skin of metal would be undefeatable for sure. And metal can be shaped into anything we want. However its not flexible... But we could still use it as a breastplate protecting most of the body from enemy weapons, although it would be heavy and reduce the dexterity of the warrior wearing it, it could save his life more than once!

#idea_currcy#1
Standardizing barter

#idea_currcy_1#1
We could try to select common goods that are small, durable and rare enough to use as standards for exchanges: anyone could exchange their goods to one of these knowing they can then trade it back against other necessities. That would facilitate trading, not having to find goods needed by both parties and beeing able to measure and store values more efficiently.

#idea_cuves#1
Metallic containers

#idea_cuves_1#1
With our new knowleges of metallurgy, we could craft larger cuves made of metal sheets to help in the fermenting and brewing of alcohols. This would be a better material than using wood or ceramic pots, and its more convenient to heat and impermeable. Such containers could improve the quality and production of our alcohol industries.

#idea_decarb#1
From cast iron to steel

#idea_decarb_1#1
Cast Iron isn't really usefull by itself: it's very strong but also very brittle and you cannot work with it. We can produce it easily but its saturated with carbon... Meanwhile, steel is also iron, but with less carbon in it. Currenlty we are making steel by taking pure iron and adding carbon to it with charcoal but its slower to produce and requires a lot of manual forging to produce while Cast Iron can be mass produced with blast furnaces. Therefore it would make steel production much easier if we could master a way to make steel out of Cast Iron by removing the extra carbon instead of making it by adding carbon to pure iron.  

#idea_democrcy#1
Governing by the people

#idea_democrcy_1#1
In response to growing inequalities and conflict in the society, philosophers propose a new form of government arguing that our country should be a public property: it should belong to all the people, as opposed to being the private property of a few individuals. The power of property must le limited, as the only legitimate source of power is the people. 

#idea_democrcy_2#1
They propose a radically new system where all decisions of the city should be taken by direct vote of all the free citizens. There would no longer be any formal Leader or priviledged nobility: all decisions would be taken by the majority, with every citizen's vote equally counted.

#idea_democrcy_3#1
However while such system might be fit for a single City-State, many of its detractors argue that this utopic governance system would lead to chaos if attempted on a larger State encompassing multiple cities as the process of voting and would become impossible to manage.

#idea_diagnos#1
What is wrong with you?

#idea_diagnos_1#1
Our bodies are machines that we could study with empiricism to understand how they break and how to fix them. Studying external signs could help doctors understand what broke and where, and what treatment is required.

#idea_domcat#1
Come here kitty!

#idea_domcat_1#1
These capricious feline animals are very usefull to keep rodents away and preserve our food stocks! We should try to tame and domesticate some of them to keep in our village.

#idea_domdog#1
Hunting companions

#idea_domdog_1#1
Wolves are fierce pack hunters. They run fast and their smell is sharp. Sometimes, some of them come lurking near the village and don't always seem to be agressive. It happens that some porcos throw them some leftovers, and they remain near the village. What if we could befriend these noble animals and have them with us to assist our hunters with their tracking skills and speed ?

#idea_domebdg#1
Indoor sky

#idea_domebdg_1#1
Using our knowledges of arch building and cranes allowing us to build taller structures, what if we tried to combines arches to create an indoor sky, a semi-spherical roof that would allow us to build glorious and impressive monuments with an indoor space so tall and so vast it would feel like having the sky above you! 

#idea_educ#1
Passing the knowledge

#idea_educ_1#1
Teaching our culture, rules, traditions and knowledges to the new generations is important. We could organize a new cast of people specialized in teaching the new generations.

#idea_eldcncl#1
Solving conflicts

#idea_eldcncl_1#1
Everyone in the tribe knows Schnappy Schnapps, the eldest son of the Porker family. Dumb as a rock and good for nothing... but no one can deny the magnifiscence of his long boar tusks. It wasnt long before Yertruden, the youngest Sow of the Truitus family, fell to his charms, which greatly upsetted his father who refused this union despite the gifts offered by the Porker elders. 

#idea_eldcncl_2#1
Tensions rose and conflict threatened the unity of the tribe. What if Porcos that have nothing to do with the conflict where chosen by the tribe to decide how to settle this situation ? 

#idea_elephrid#1
The sow and the elephant

#idea_elephrid_1#1
In one small paddock was kept an elephant, a mighty beast captured from the wilderness and now kept in captivity as livestock or maybe just by curiosity. Most people were afraid to approach but every day a lonely young sow would go to the beast to feed him with fresh vegetables, fascinated by its magesty. To her the animal didn't look feriocious: she saw intelligence and sadness in its eyes. As time passed, she built trust with the elephant who would wait for her and greet her with her trunk when she arrived.

#idea_elephrid_2#1
One night, she decided to free the elephant from its paddock: the animal fled and the sow felt happy. Months passed and the turmoils of this event faded... Later, as she was wandering in the woods after a heavy storm, she fell into a mud hole and got stuck under a fallen tree trunk. For many hours she called for help. But noone ever came... not even the elephant which, unbeknownst to all, was in fact lying dead in a ditch not far away after getting stuck in a mud hole as well. But this tragic story gave another porco some thoughs: first that mud holes are dangerous. And then that surely if an elephant had happened to be there he could have easily pulled that trunk to save the sow... if only the one they had hadn't escaped a few weeks before!

#idea_elephrid2#1
The sow and the mammoth

#idea_elephrid2_1#1
In one small paddock was kept a mammoth, a mighty beast captured from the wilderness and now kept in captivity as livestock or maybe just by curiosity. Most people were afraid to approach but every day a lonely young sow would go to the beast to feed him with fresh vegetables, fascinated by its magesty. To her the animal didn't look feriocious: she saw intelligence and sadness in its eyes. As time passed, she built trust with the mammoth who would wait for her and greet her with her trunk when she arrived.

#idea_engineer#1
The science of innovation

#idea_engineer_1#1
We need construction masters specialized in solving problems and innovating, producing new techniques and methods by exploiting our knowledges of the sciences.

#idea_ferment#1
The forgotten pot

#idea_ferment_1#1
One day, a Porco left a few leftover grains in a pot outside of his hut. Forgotten, they remained there for days under the rain. Later, while cleaning stuff around his hut, the Porco happened to cover the pot by stacking other baskets on top of it without noticing its content. When he eventually rediscovered the pot, from its content came a strange somewhat appealing smell. Curious by nature, the hog tasted the drink and felt funny afterwards.

#idea_fineryforg#1
Working with cast iron

#idea_fineryforg_1#1
Iron is a capricious metal hard to work with. If you heat it just enough to soften, with a lot of manual forging you can work it into a maleable but flexible soft metal. However if you melt it completely to the point of casting it, it becomes very hard but brittle and impossible to work with! Blast furnaces are very efficient and fast but they are so efficient they only produce this cast iron we do not know how to work with properly... Heating and hammering it for a long time allows to slowly remove the carbon, eventually producing pure 'rough iron'. Using our knowledges of mechanics, we could try to create special forges making this operation much more faster and efficient, allowing us to streamline iron production out of cast iron ingots we can already mass produce with bast furnaces.

#idea_fishboat#1
Floating on water

#idea_fishboat_1#1
Many things float on water, such as fallen tree trunks. It's not easy to stand on one though... but if we carved a hole in it, we could fit one or more porcos. Instead of beeing stuck on the coast throwing nets to catch fishes, with such device, fisherpigs could reach more distant fishes and catch them more efficiently!

#idea_foodstor#1
Protecting the food

#idea_foodstor_1#1
By making special storages isolated from the ground, we could improve food storage and its protection against rodents and other vermins.

#idea_forg#1
Shaping metal with heat and pressure

#idea_forg_1#1
Working with Iron is difficult and requires to keep the metal heated during the whole process. To do this efficiently and in order to master this art, we need to develop and design special furnaces and tools to work this metal.

#idea_furnitr#1
A more comfortable home

#idea_furnitr_1#1
Instead of living in mostly empty huts and sleeping on the floor on small mats, some porcos propose to start crafting more refined objects out of woodcarving and metal to use inside homes to replace built in shelves, benches and sleeping bunks. These lighter and mobile furnitures would increase the life quality and comfort of those who can afford them while creating a new craftmanship, growing our economy.

#idea_garden#1
D�corative agriculture

#idea_garden_1#1
Plants are not only good for food. Their soothing presence promotes rest and relaxation, and embellishes the environment. Like plants cultivated for their usefulness, we could develop the art of cultivating and organizing plants solely for their aesthetics.

#idea_geometry#1
The properties of space

#idea_geometry_1#1
We could improve our surveying and construction by studying the principles of space: lenghts, areas, angles and volumes.

#idea_gillnet#1
Entangling fishes

#idea_gillnet_1#1
Most of the times when casting nets on fishes, they remain entangled in the net itself with no need of beeing actually trapped in it. What if we simply made a net 'wall' standing in the water waiting for the fishes to entangle themselves without having to do anything ? We could use floaters one one edge and weights on the opposite one so it would stand vertically in the water and catch all the bigger fishes trying to pass through! Such technique could facilitate the work of fisherpigs and increase their efficiency.

#idea_glaz#1
A new glazing technique

#idea_glaz_1#1
By firing pottery at high temperature after plastering it with various substances, one can obtain surprising results: improved solidity, shine, color, impermeability... Some potters have noticed that the use of a Tin based plaster made it possible to obtain a white and shiny estheticaly pleasing glaze which could also be used as a base for decorative paintings.

#idea_glaz_2#1
To his horror, he saw the ashes spread over all his freshly made pots he was planning to bake later on in the evening. Not willing to lose his whole batch, after trying to clean some of the ash he decided to bake them anyways.

#idea_glaz_3#1
To his surprise, the pots came out much different than usual pots. They looked shinier and smoother than ever. 

#idea_glue#1
A new adhesive

#idea_glue_1#1
Animal butchery and fisheries produces many leftovers which have no use. Some propose to experiment what we could do with some of them: tanners noticed that by boiling skins it sometimes produces a sticky jelly that hardens when it cools off. A furniture maker wants to experiment on this idea to see if this could be used as an adhesive substance strong enough to hold pieces of wood together, which could greatly improve the quality and production of fine furnitures.

#idea_goldsmth#1
Artistic metalworking

#idea_goldsmth_1#1
While artisans are growing more skilled in the arts of metalworking, some with a more creative side noted how specific metals are not only visually appealing but also very durable and offering the unlimited creative possibilities compared to more rigid materials. They are eager to try developping new skills to work them in the service of art rather than practicality.

#idea_gov#1
Specializing governance

#idea_gov_1#1
With our new systems of written law and independent treasury, we can grow our governance into a more complex and organized system of civil servants with legally defined responsabilities and hierarchy. We could improve our ability to manage more things by specializing these officials under the authority of Ministers, mandated by the Leader and each one in charge of a specific domain of governance.

#idea_granary#1
Arches and granaries

#idea_granary_1#1
Using our new knowledge of arch building, we could build better elevated granaries withstanding heavier loads, allowing us to store more foods in them. 

#idea_grndmining#1
Digging underground

#idea_grndmining_1#1
There's a limit to how much ore is available directly on the surface. It keeps going underground like rivers of rock, and we have to learn how to follow it. We could start digging tunnels completely underground to follow and exploit the ore!

#idea_guard#1
Guards

#idea_guard_1#1
Who is going to ensure everyone pays their due ? Who is going to go shake the sows and piglets so that a stubborn Porco reveals the precious wares he was hidding burried under his hut's floor and refusing to pay as tribute to your highness ? 

#idea_guard_2#1
Surely the officials of the government shouldnt belittle themselves in doing such tasks. Plus most of them are not exactly in shape to impress hardened peasants... However what if we used some of these tributes to pay strong Porcos of to escort the officials and do the dirty work? The people would think twice before contesting our authority!

#idea_hallcity#1
A local government

#idea_hallcity_1#1
With our new administrative innovations, we should invest resources to improve the organization of local townhalls to better manage the local population and the Countryside territories by delegating more power and responsabilities to them when need be. This would facilitate the management of larger towns, managed by efficient and developped regional governments.

#idea_hallcomn#1
A place for the community

#idea_hallcomn_1#1
As our tribe grows, more things related to the organization of the local community require communication, time and attention. What if we built a large longhouse common to all and with no other purpose than serving as a gathering point for the community to discuss and organize local matters? This would surely improve the management of our small tribe.

#idea_halltown#1
A local administration

#idea_halltown_1#1
As our settlement size and population grows, so does the amount of small everyday local matters. The Chieftain has no time to manage all these time consumming matters himself. By growing the commmunity hall into a bigger house employing servants of the chief devotted only to the organization of the local territory and its affairs, the management of the settlement would be greatly improved.

#idea_helbard#1
Improving spears

#idea_helbard_1#1
Some weaponsmiths proposed to build a new versatile pole weapon combining the features of spears and battleaxes into one. With its high reach it could be efficient against other pikes and spears infantry but also against mounted units while beeing also able to cut and slash with its side blade.

#idea_herb#1
Knowing the plants

#idea_herb_1#1
Nature created many different plants, fruits and roots. If we take time to study their effects, we could get new knowledges on how to cure some of the afflictions our people suffers. 

#idea_hops#1
A new beer flavor

#idea_hops_1#1
Some brewers propose to replace the mix of herbs and spices used traditionally to balance the sweet malt flavors in beer by a new plant's flower called 'hops'. This heresy is supported by the claim that on top of adding a nice pleasuring flavor to beer, it would also increase its preservation making it storable for a longer time. That's been a major issue of beer making and improving its shelf life would greatly improve the industry's production by reducing waste.

#idea_horsebckrid#1
Travelling on animals

#idea_horsebckrid_1#1
Some animals are strong enough to carry heavy loads on their backs, so why not us? If we can select the most adapted and docile breeds to do so, and how to teach them to obey our orders, we could travel directly on their backs instead of using carts and heavy chariots attached on their backs. It would make travelling on it more practical and fast, and it would open new perspectives for warefare as well!

#idea_hvhelmet#1
Improving helmets

#idea_hvhelmet_1#1
Why not cover the whole face and sides with metal as well with our helmets? Sure it would reduce the field of vision for our warriors, but it would look sick. It would also improve their armor too...

#idea_hvshield#1
Bigger shields

#idea_hvshield_1#1
What if we made shields larger and tall enough to stand directly on the ground and wide enough for the soldier to be fully protected behind it? It would allow units to withstand heavy charges by taking support on the shields. These heavy items would however slow down troops and limit their movements, reducing their combat skill.

#idea_iron#1
A new metal

#idea_iron_1#1
What if there is more metals we havn't discovered yet? Some red stones seem to hide a different metal we know nothing off, but that seem to be considerably harder to extract and work with. However making bronze out of Copper and the rarer Tin is a complicated process that makes us rely on 2 different metals and dependent on trade. Maybe this new metal, while harder to extract, could be an alternative to Bronze?

#idea_irrig#1
Watering the plants

#idea_irrig_1#1
The ground is sometimes too dry for cultivating plants. What if we created our own artificial rivers to carry water into the fields and water their soil ?

#idea_javelin#1
Throwing sticks

#idea_javelin_1#1
Instead of beating beasts and foes with cudgels, some propose to create lighter and balanced pointy sticks of wood that we could throw from a distance with some training. Imagine killing an enemy without even having to get near him! This would be of great support for hunters but also to defend our tribe against pillagers from behind a palissade or on top of a cliff!

#idea_jewelry#1
Wearing adornments

#idea_jewelry_1#1
It is in the very nature of Porcos to be attracted by shiny things, and thus came the idea to wear them in order to look more desirable.

#idea_jewelry_2#1
So some Porcos became curious to start looking for new shiny things that are more rare to come by and thus more precious, but also how to develop new ways to work them with tools to make new decorative shapes and motives out the same materials. These precious items, despite having no practical use, can become highly desirable as ways to express personnality or social status through their rarity and craftsmanship.

#idea_kiln#1
Building large ovens

#idea_kiln_1#1
Instead of using temporary one-time-use ovens covered with clay to bake charcoal or pottery, we could try to build bigger solid reusable ovens that would increase the quality and production speed of our baking operations, built with heat resistant bricks. That would benefit our potters but also the production of charcoal!

#idea_lamnrarm#1
A flexible cuirass

#idea_lamnrarm_1#1
Breastplate armors offers good protection but significantly reduce the mobility of its wearer. Rather than using a single piece of solid metal to protect the torso, maybe instead we could take advantage of the flexibility of iron and steel to create a new type of armor made of multiple strips that would offer a good compromise of mobility, solidity, and ease of production?

#idea_lawmkrs#1
A new institution of high officials

#idea_lawmkrs_1#1
Our society grows more complex every day, so does sources of conflict amongst our citizens. While general laws can be simple to grasp, the increasing number of conflictual situations rises the need for more accurate laws for specific domains, which demand more time to discuss and design. Advisors propose the creation of a new institution of High Officials devoted only to the discussion and writting of laws.

#idea_laws#1
Rules for everyone

#idea_laws_1#1
A universal set of laws, defined by the government, would improve the fairness of our society by making sure everyone is suject to the same rules!

#idea_lead#1
One Porco to rule them all

#idea_lead_1#1
All these talks to try convincing everyone of the tribe to do anything are just taking too long. Too much talking, too much negociating, too much time wasted. Some are more worthy to rule than others, anyways... And it should be you, of course, you just know it! All you could do if you weren't slowed down by having to convince everyone else every time... It was fine before, but now the village has grown and there's just too many people. 

#idea_lever#1
I shall move the Earth

#idea_lever_1#1
Using the principles of mathematics and geometry, some pretend we could have a single Porco exert the force of 10. What kind of sorcery would that be? If this where to be possible, we could have move and uplift weights that would normally require a tremendous amount of workers with only a few!

#idea_lhelmet#1
Hats of metal

#idea_lhelmet_1#1
Most fatal blows for warriors are to the head. With our new knowledge of metallurgy we can shape something solid into anything we want. We should make hats made of hard metal, that would greatly improve the protection of our warriors.

#idea_longbow#1
Long range murdering

#idea_longbow_1#1
The bigger and stronger the bow, the more powerful becomes its release. It could fire arrows at higher ranges and deal more damage, but it will also be harder to master and will require much more training.

#idea_longsword#1
Double handed swords

#idea_longsword_1#1
Using our new forging techniques, we could now attempt to create longer and lighter swords. Such formidable weapons would require 2 hands to be manipulated, forbidding the ability to combine it with shields, but a skilled warrior would be unstopable and nothing would be able to withstand its blows! 

#idea_loom2#1
A machine to help weaving

#idea_loom2_1#1
Instead of manually weaving cloth which takes a very long time, maybe we could build some sort of structure helping the artisans in the process of weaving and sorting all the different threads required. That could really increase the speed at which our weavers can produce textile!

#idea_loom3#1
Improving looms

#idea_loom3_1#1
Vetical warp-weighted looms are primitive and impractical to use. With the increased experience of our weavers and our better woodworking tools, some propose to research an improved design of handlooms that would increase their productivity and comfort.

#idea_loom4#1
Mechanical looms

#idea_loom4_1#1
Using our new knoweldges of pulleys, we could apply such mechanics to create bigger and better looms with new automated functions using a clever system of levers, pulleys and foot-treadles. These much bigger looms would increase the production and quality of all our weavers.

#idea_loom5#1
Weaving bigger textiles

#idea_loom5_1#1
The 'shuttle' is a piece of the loom that needs to go from one side of the textile to the other constantly. Its a fastidious and tiring operation for the weaver, requiring to constantly bend over the machine to move the shuttle, and it limits the size of the woven textile to his arm's lenght or it requires complex coordination between multiple workers. If we could find a way to improve this process with mechanics, it could greatly improve the productivity of our textile industries and the working conditions of our weavers.

#idea_loom6#1
idea_loom6

#idea_loom6_1#1
idea_loom6_1

#idea_manure#1
Greener grass

#idea_manure_1#1
Farmers noticed that the grass is always greener where cattle has been left grazing. Why is that?

#idea_market#1
A place for exchanges

#idea_market_1#1
To facilitate exchanges with other foreign cities, we could create a special place for traders to gather and store goods meants to be exported. These specialized traders would continuously travel and keep contact with other cities to know what they have to buy and sell at which prices. This would allow us to directly buy and sell resources with our partner cities with currency.

#idea_marriag#1
Alliance through familly

#idea_marriag_1#1
How could we build a trusted alliance with another tribe? One familly elder has an idea: to offer the Chieftain's daughter in marriage to the son of the other tribe's chieftain will create a mutual commitment to uphold the alliance terms and forever bind the 2 tribes in blood.

#idea_masonry#1
Building out of small things

#idea_masonry_1#1
Mastering the technique of building with bricks and mortar would allow us to greatly improve our building techniques, making structures taller, lighter, and more solid. But most of all the use of a standardized material facililtates its production and storage while speeding up the actual construction.

#idea_metalrgy#1
A shiny stone

#idea_metalrgy_1#1
One day, a jewelry maker who was weary from his work decided to take a day off to wander around the village and rest. He found his way to a small river of cristalline waters and decided this would be the perfect spot to take a nap and enjoy a beautiful day.

#idea_metalrgy_2#1
As he was resting and contemplating the reflection of the sky in the flowing water, he noticed a strange glittering coming from below the river's shallow waters. 

#idea_metalrgy_3#1
Fascinated, he looked at it from upclose while rolling it between his fingers. The stone was unusually heavy and smooth. It had the color of the sun and was as shiny as a drop of water. 

#idea_metcast#1
Liquid metals

#idea_metcast_1#1
Metals become soft and maleable when heated in large fires. The hotter, the more maleable and soft they seem to become... So what if we improved our furnaces to heat them so much they would become temporarly as liquid as fresh water? We could litteraly pour the metal into holes with the desired shape right away instead of having to work it with manual hammering. If we can master this technique, that would allow us to mass produce items and weapons at a much higher speed and with a much more consistent quality!

#idea_metrolog#1
Units of measurement

#idea_metrolog_1#1
The ability to measure alone is insufficient; standardisation is crucial for measurements to be meaningful. We need to create units of measurements for distances, weights and volumes.

#idea_metshield#1
Improving shields

#idea_metshield_1#1
We could produce stronger but heavier shields by adding a metal sheet on their surface on top of wood, if we can master the proper way to do this.

#idea_miningtl#1
Improving ore extraction

#idea_miningtl_1#1
Using our new knowledges of metallurgy we can now produce better tools. Its time to design proper tools specialized into mining operations, which would greatly improve the speed of ore extraction instead of simply relying on lighting fires waiting for the rock to crack!

#idea_mudbdg#1
Using dirt

#idea_mudbdg_1#1
Sometimes mud dries under the sun and becomes really hard and solid. What if we used mud to cover and isolate our huts ? We could maker bigger and more solid huts just out of dirt!

#idea_mudbrick#1
Making cubes of dirt

#idea_mudbrick_1#1
What if we find a way to make solid cubes out of mud, using just dirt and water? That would allow us to build a lot of things out of nothing but dirt!

#idea_multistor#1
Building taller

#idea_multistor_1#1
With all our current architectural knowledges, we should be able to master new techniques and expertise to build taller structures with multiple floors. This could allow us to house more people in places where ground space is limited!

#idea_obsidn#1
Shiny black stones

#idea_obsidn_1#1
The weaponmakers of the tribe noticed that this special shiny black stone called obsidian is much better than regular flint: when broken, it is sharper than anything they've ever seen and it can cut through anything. What if we tried to make deadly weapons out of it? Now the stones are usually small, but one craftpig had this idea: what if we inserted several of them into wooden poles to create a longer continuous blade in the shape that we want? 

#idea_oliveoil#1
New berries

#idea_oliveoil_1#1
On knotted trunk trees grow small berries some porco enjoy to eat. That is until someone had the idea to squeeze them to get juice out of it... it produces an oily liquid that tastes really nice with other foods, and that can also have many other uses such as a snout skin care product or to keep a shiny pig furr. We should learn to cultivate these trees and how to efficiently press its berries to start producing more of this precious oil.

#idea_orecrush#1
Mechanical crushing

#idea_orecrush_1#1
Using our new knowledges of engineering and gears, we could improve the labour intensive process of crushing ores into smaller stones which is required to process them and make them ready for efficient smelting. Using a mill and mechanisms, ore crushing could be vastly improved, freeing workforce to help making our mines more efficient.

#idea_packanim#1
Bags on animals

#idea_packanim_1#1
Animals are stronger than people. If we could get some to carry bags on their backs, it would greatly improve our ability to move cargo between territories.

#idea_paddarm#1
Wearable mattresses

#idea_paddarm_1#1
Leather is well resistant to cutting, but not really efficient in cushionning blows. Some artisans propose to create a thicker type of armor designed to cushion enemy blows by using cotton and 'quilting': sewing several layers of fabric together. They claim such armor, even by itself, could prove far more efficient than expected while only using cheap materials. It could also be used in addition to other types of armor worn above it.

#idea_paparmor#1
idea_paparmor

#idea_paparmor_1#1
idea_paparmor_1

#idea_paper#1
Sheets of wood

#idea_paper_1#1
Wood is abundant and readily available. It is possible to write on tablets of wood, but it is heavy and hard to transport or store... But maybe we could try to find a way to grind it into a paste and dry it into fine sheets we could store and carry more easily!

#idea_philo#1
The meaning of life

#idea_philo_1#1
What is real? Do we have free will? What is the best way to live? 

#idea_phonetic#1
Writting sounds

#idea_phonetic_1#1
Instead of having one sign for each object or idea, we could have signs that represent sounds... similar to how people speak. This way, with fewer signs we could writte everything as we speak! This would make writting much faster and easier to learn and transmit.

#idea_pickaxe#1
A tool harder than stone

#idea_pickaxe_1#1
Using steel, we could now produce a tool harder than most stones. If we can design such a tool, using it in our mines would greatly increase the efficiency of all our miners!

#idea_pictgrm#1
Writting pictures

#idea_pictgrm_1#1
We could create more signs to represents more and more objects, but also actions and ideas! We could start writting about stories and events, saving the history of our people instead of just using it to keep track of transactions, payments and debts.

#idea_plantselect#1
Keeping the best plants

#idea_plantselect_1#1
What if by keeping the plants that gave the best results and replanting only those, we could improve the whole production ? This is probably going to take a while, but if we keep doing this our cultures could greatly improve!

#idea_platearm#1
Total armor

#idea_platearm_1#1
Thanks to our mastery of steel and forging, we could design a new type of armor fully covering the body with mobile, hand-forged and custom-made steel plates. Assembled together they would form an impenetrable armor protecting every inch of the wearer from head to toe. Such armor would be very time consuming and expensive to produce but would offer unparalleled protection.

#idea_plough#1
Turning the soil upside down

#idea_plough_1#1
Instead of simply scratching the soil with an ard we could build a modified version of it that would not only dig deeper but also turn the soil upside down, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. This would improve the homogeneity of the soil as well as improving its fertility, increasing the efficiency of our farms further more! 

#idea_portage#1
Carrying goods

#idea_portage_1#1
We could have people specialized in carrying goods between territories, who would ensure a constant transfer of resources making sure it never runs out, instead of relying on manual one-time caravans.

#idea_postal#1
An organized network of messenger relays

#idea_postal_1#1
Good communication is key to a well managed government. A Minister is proposing that we invest in the creation of a well organized network of communication relays maintained at the expense of the government but ensuring that important public and private missives could travel great distances in reccord time.

#idea_postal_2#1
This could improve a lot the management of our farthest regions, but with a significant cost: he proposes nothing less but to build and maintain at a network of small relays staffed with our fastest mounts and messengers ready to depart at all hours. If one arrives to a relay with an exhausted mount, he can stay and rest in it after passing his mail to the other messenger who will depart immediately towards the next relay.

#idea_prefects#1
Improving the administration of subordinates

#idea_prefects_1#1
We have no way to know what's really going on on our vassals and subordinates territories beyond what they are choosing to tell us. Sending officials loyal to us take post directly in the vassal territories would not only improve communication with their administration but it would allow us to better observe and monitor their activity ensuring everything is as it should be. 

#idea_privl#1
I deserve retribution!

#idea_privl_1#1
The tribe is growing and as its dominant leader you now spend a lot of your time managing things and discussing matters of the tribe, with less and less time to participate in lower tasks and work like any other tribespig.

#idea_privl_2#1
And what would the tribe become without your benevolent work ? Don't you deserve to be rewarded and assisted for your hard work ? And how can you earn the respect of the tribe if you just appear to be their equal ? Then some will always try to contest your legitimacy as a ruler!

#idea_prprt#1
This is mine

#idea_prprt_1#1
The tribe is now growing bigger and, since we decided to settle down, we now have many objects and tools: much more than what the ancients used to have in their nomadic lives! But a strange thing is happening as this abundance of things seems to be creating tensions amongst us. Some porcos who spent a lot of time crafting things resent having to share them with others they dont feel are doing as much as them. 

#idea_prprt_2#1
One Porco is proposing that we all agree not to take things from another family without their permission. A strange concept... but these are strange times. 

#idea_ptrwhl#1
Rotating pots

#idea_ptrwhl_1#1
A potter had an idea: what if rather than making potteries by rotating the hands around the pot stacking coils of clay on top of one another, it was the pottery that spun on itself while the hands remained still? Not only would this make pots considerably faster to produce, but it would also result in a much finer pottery. The only thing that remains is to master this more difficult technique and to design a practical mechanism that can reliably spin the work plan...

#idea_ptry#1
The mud baskets

#idea_ptry1_1#1
A piglet playing in the mud noticed a special type of maleable mud that dried under the sun and started playing with it. His mother is a basket crafter for the tribe. Unfortunately, her baskets are not the finest ones there is, and gatherers often complain about their crude weaving: cereals often slip through and rats manage to steal the rest.

#idea_ptry1_2#1
Upon seeing her mud covered son coming back, she had the idea to cover one of her baskets with it and let it dry in a sunny afternoon, making it more hermetic and putting an end to the gatherers' critics.

#idea_ptry1_3#1
Unfortunately, the basket didnt last long and the mud quickly cracked and fell from the basket's frame. She would like to request the help of a few tribespigs to go collect more of this mud and time to try make more of these special baskets. Near the tribe's bondfire at nights, its often hotter than a sunny summer afternoon: she thinks that we should try placing the special mud near a very big fire to make it dry faster and harder.

#idea_puddlngforg#1

#idea_puddlngforg_1#1
puddlngforg_1

#idea_pulley#1
Levers with wheels

#idea_pulley_1#1
Using the principle of the lever and combining it with wheels and ropes, we could create a new simple machine that allows us to lift heavy weights vertically and in a much simplier, space efficient, and convenient way than using levers.

#idea_quarr#1
Improving stone extraction

#idea_quarr_1#1
We could improve the extraction of stone blocks by using pulleys and building wooden scaffoldings against the rock. 

#idea_quarrhv#1
Lifting stones

#idea_quarrhv_1#1
Using the mechanics of the treadwheel crane allowing us to move and lift heavier weight easily, we could improve the efficiency of our quarrying operations.

#idea_regadmin#1
Growing beyond a single region

#idea_regadmin_1#1
With the development of our governance towards a more organized institution with an independent treasury and a hierachy of civil servants employed by it, the idea comes of reorganizing territories into different regions instead of ruling everything from a single unique location. 

#idea_regadmin_2#1
Each region would have its own local government located in its regional center while remaining under the authority of the central government. Such system would surely come with the cost of weakenning the strength of our central government, but at the same time it would allow us to grow our state beyond the limits of our region and to start managing multiple cities each one ruling over its own local territories.

#idea_republic#1
Governing for the people

#idea_republic_1#1
Inspired by the novel ideas of Democracy but critical of its flaws, philosophers propose a new form of government they came to call "Republic": a system that they claim would be less radical than direct Democracy and more fit for the management of a more modern multi-city State.

#idea_republic_2#1
Some argue that Democracy is just another form of tyranny, not by an individual but by the majority. Piggybius even goes as far as to claim that Democracy is a form of government doomed to fail as it will inevitably decay towards the worst form of governance that is the rule of the mob through demagogy and populism.

#idea_republic_3#1
Instead, in a Republic, rulers remain in power but draw their legitimacy from the people and are meant to rule only in its name and not for private interests. They do not own the country, but are only entrusted with the responsabilities of leading it for the interests of its people, including minorities, thus rejecting the "tyranny of the majority" of direct democracy.

#idea_rotgraz#1
Leave the pastures alone!

#idea_rotgraz_1#1
The idea would be to have herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. It might feel like a waste of space and resources, but resting grazed lands could allow the vegetation to renew and rebuild while providing younger tender plant stems of better quality for the grazers when they're back, giving them more nutricious food than if it had been continuously exploited. We just need to sort out the proper way to organize the rotation of pastures in the most efficient way possible and how to manage moving the animals.

#idea_rum#1
Yarr!

#idea_rum_1#1
In the woods grow a special kind of thin wood that smells and tastes really nice and sweet. It wasnt long before some experimented extracting juice out of it to make a tasty beverage out of it. But after experimenting with a few pots that had been left out for too long in the heat, some Porcos noticed how different it tasted, and how much more intoxicating it was. We should experiment more with this special wood and find a way to reproduce and improve these tasty beverages that make Porcos feel happier.

#idea_runwat#1
Water at home

#idea_runwat_1#1
What if, in the same way we irrigate fields, we would create small water canals delivering fresh water directly to every home in the city so the people no longer need to get it themselves at the well ?

#idea_salt#1
Food conservation

#idea_salt_1#1
Porcos have been enjoying the taste of some special rocks since the dawn of times. White, friable, and soluble, they can be found directly on some rare places often near water and it's common practice to collect them and keep them as tasty treats. One porco who particularly enjoyed it once got too enthusiastic and covered meat with it and noticed it then laster for much longer before spoiling. A truely magical substance!

#idea_scalearm#1
Clothes of metal

#idea_scalearm_1#1
Metal is hard and resistent. What if our warrior could wear clothes made of metal to resist enemy blows? Unfortunately its not exactly flexible like cloth... What if, like the scales of the fish, we made a metallic skin made of small scales covering each other, still allowing its wearer to move while beeing heavily protected?

#idea_seal#1
Authenticating missives

#idea_seal_1#1
With cities away from our capital's palace and written documents having to travel increasing distances entrusted to messengers sometimes for days, how can we ensure their authenticity? Some scribes are offering a simple solution: the practice of engraving unique intricated stamps which would be given to every important member of the Leader's family or administration, and used to sign documents or to seal important messages with wax inprinted by it.

#idea_sedent#1
Sedentary life

#idea_sedent_1#1
On one evening by the tribe's camp fire, Grooeky Lazysnout spoke in these words: 

#idea_sedent_2#1
<< We have everything we need here! What if we stopped moving around like the ancients, and stayed for good in this territory ? I am tired of mounting and dismounting these tents every day! By staying in the same place we could accumulate more tools and more things without having to worry about carrying them! >>

#idea_sewers#1
Underground canals

#idea_sewers_1#1
Smelly swine waste is accumulating in the streets of larger settlements. What if, using your knowledges in masonry and water working, we built a network of underground canals would carry waste out of the city?

#idea_shield#1
Countering blows

#idea_shield_1#1
To protect ourselves in hand to hand combat or against enemies throwing javelins, arrows, we could try to craft light armors of wood and strong leather that soldiers would carry on one arm to counter blows.

#idea_sledge#1
Pushing heavy weights

#idea_sledge_1#1
Using wooden sledges sliding on greased rails, we could easily move really heavy things such as stone, improving the efficiency and speed of our builders.

#idea_smelt#1
Hidden in the rock

#idea_smelt_1#1
An old toolmaker was working one night on making a tool out of these unusual rocks that last much longer than regular ones. His sight wasn't what it used to be, and so when he has to work at night, he took the habbit of doing so at the light of a bright open fire. That night, in a moment of inattention, he happened to drop his work right into the blaze. Disheartened by his clumsiness, he left it there for the night. The next day, retreiving his tool from the ashes of the fire, he was surprised to find it had completely changed shape to look like a strange solid pool of water. Maybe the magic of fire has yet more to offer?

#idea_soilcol#1
Swine fertilizers

#idea_soilcol_1#1
There is a lot of waste generated in cities. If we organized its collection we could use it in the same way we use animal manure, to fertilize our crops while making our streets a bit less smelly.

#idea_spear#1
Pointy sticks

#idea_spear_1#1
With our new knowledge of metallurgy, we could now craft longer spears ending with a stronger metallic head instead of simple sharpenned wooden sticks allowing to fight enemies in hand to hand combat while keeping it distant.

#idea_sprfish#1
Do you like fish sticks?

#idea_sprfish_1#1
Strange animals live in the water. Tasty ones, if we managed to catch them for they move too swiftly for our piggy hands. Maybe we could throw sticks like we hunt beasts in the wilderness to catch them, if we can master this skill!

#idea_stdprtmnt#1
Papers please!

#idea_stdprtmnt_1#1
More administrative needs means more bureaucracy. More bureaucracy demands more civil servants. More civil servants require more space. Let's build glorious bureaucratic departments filled with paper pushers of low efficiency, because this is the way.

#idea_steel#1
Iron alloys

#idea_steel_1#1
It appears that iron heated in contact with charcoal gets stronger but also more brittle. Too much of it and it becomes useless... But if we were to master the art of dosing and it properly and a process of how to apply it to iron, we could produce a metal far superior than everything we've ever seen so far: steel, at the right balance between flexibility and resistance.

#idea_stlshld#1
Updating shields

#idea_stlshld_1#1
Steel is stronger, lighter and more flexible than any other metals we've ever had. We could use it to improve our shields for our elite units, combining lightweightness and resistance by reinforcing wood and leather with a thin sheet of steel.

#idea_stonebdg#1
Stacking stones

#idea_stonebdg_1#1
Stone is solid and available everywhere. If we could master the technique to make buildings by stacking them together, we could improve our constructions and make great things.

#idea_stonecut#1
Shaping the stones

#idea_stonecut_1#1
Instead of assembling and stacking random stones of various size and shapes, we should master the technique of shapping and cutting them into cubes like bricks, using our new tools of metal. It would allow to construct things more easily, more solid, and more efficiently.

#idea_storhaul#1
Draft animals

#idea_storhaul_1#1
We could try to train and domesticate animals into pulling heavy weights on wheeled carts, which could improve our warehouses by facilitating their management and allowing to store heavier bulks of goods.

#idea_storheav#1
Moving heavier things

#idea_storheav_1#1
Using pulleys and tradewheel cranes, we can lift and move heavier weights. Applying these to warehouses we could store even bigger bulks of goods on small spaces while still beeing able to manage and move them.

#idea_sword#1
Long battle knives

#idea_sword_1#1
What if instead of fixing a knife at the end of a stick, we made a knife with a blade long enough that you could use it directly into battle? What used to be impossible with mere stone tools now is with metal. It's heavier than wood, but its also more resistent. Sure it wouldnt be as long as a spear, but it would be able to cut enemies at any point of it lenght while still beeing able to thrust like a spear. This would open up more fighting techniques for skilled soldiers and would make for a great melee weapon, lighter and less encumbrant than spears. 

#idea_tanning#1
Smoking hides

#idea_tanning_1#1
Animal hides are smelly and they decay, harden, and rot pretty quickly. We need to find ways to improve their durability by preventing their putrefaction. To do that we should master the proper way to clean and process the hides: removing hair, scrapping all the leftover flesh, and drying them with smoke and sun in the same way we smoke meat to make it last longer.

#idea_tax#1
Taxes

#idea_tax_1#1
Designing a better taxing system would improve the efficiency of our Tax collectors.

#idea_taxation#1
Moneraty tributes

#idea_taxation_1#1
With the growing adoption of coins in our economy, we could develop an improved taxation system no longer based on seizing produced material goods from the population but on taxing their incomes in coins.

#idea_taxation_2#1
This way, instead of having to manage the seizure, storage, and reselling of the goods taken to producers with tributes, the government could simply tax the monetary profits made by these producers when they sell their whole production.

#idea_territcntrl#1
Territorial patrols

#idea_territcntrl_1#1
There are many other tribes around us, and limited land. It would probably be a good idea to claim empty lands we might need in the future for our people, and to send a clear message to neighbors that these belong to our territory, even if they remain unused. Organizing patrols to control these territories would be a good way to send this message and ensure that no foreign tribe may enter our land without our knowledge.

#idea_tradewg#1
Pulling chariots

#idea_tradewg_1#1
Instead of puting a few bags on the back of some animaks, we could try to get them to pull big chariots that could carry much more cargo.

#idea_transac#1
Transaction tracking

#idea_transac_1#1
We could try to create a system of making marks with special meanings on things like clay to keep track of transactions and payments, to make sure nothing gets forgotten and that everyone does what they're supposed to.

#idea_trbtries#1
Hostages for the vanquished

#idea_trbtries_1#1
How can we keep in line a vassal who was unwillingly forced into submission? We need leverage to ensure their leaders will not betray us the minut we turn our backs on them. For this some advisors recommand taking their sons as tributaries: they will be kept in our care in our city and educated in our ways and used as hostages in the event of the subjugated vassal attempting a rebellion.

#idea_trdwheelcr#1
A machine to lift things

#idea_trdwheelcr_1#1
Using our knowledge of mechanics, what if instead of relying on simple levers and pulleys installed when we need them we tried to design and build a machine specialized in moving, rotating and lifting weights, improving further more the speed and capacity to move things using only a few workers? Such machine could improve our capacity to build more impressive monuments or help improve our storage and docks!

#idea_treasury#1
Public funds

#idea_treasury_1#1
An increasing amount of expenses are needed for the good of the community wether it's to pay for the maintenance of communal structures or to pay warriors, scribes and servants of the Leader. The ruling family is increasingly reluctant to spend what they feel is theirs for their personnal use, and the confusion of this situation complicates the administration of the city.

#idea_treasury_2#1
Scribes are proposing the separation of resources dedicated to the governance of the community and the personnal funds of the ruling family, saying it will allow for a better management of the community's resources. They are proposing the idea of creating a "Treasury": a separated office employing scribes only dedicated to the management of finances and serving as intermediaries between the Leader and all the daily expenses management required to run the city.

#idea_treaties#1
Writen deals

#idea_treaties_1#1
Spoken words are easy to forget or deform with time. With our ability to write language, we could now develop the practice of writting in great details the terms of what is being agreed to with other states, so that no party can later deny the terms of an arrangement. This would allow us to increase the complexity and trust of our arrangements with foreign powers.

#idea_tribut#1
Tributes

#idea_tribut_1#1
Instead of relying on voluntary contributions from the people, its time to set rules and force everyone to give their share for the common good of everyone... to us in the government of course.

#idea_urunhair#1
Improving tanning

#idea_urunhair_1#1
Removing the hair out of the hides is a really labor intensive process that requires a lot of time but is necessary to process the hides into more durable leather. But some tanners with questionnable hobbies advanced that by using urine and soaking the hides for a long time in it makes the hair removing much easier afterwards. This nasty process could greatly improve the efficiency of our tanneries, but its definilty not going to improve the problem of their pestilence...

#idea_vassals#1
A decentralized hierachy

#idea_vassals_1#1
Having everything centralized under the authority of the single Nation Leader can burden the administration and management of the nation. A new system of customs and laws could allow subordinates to have their own subordinates, creating a pyramidal hierarchy where each liedge is in charge of its own vassals. This would decentralize the organization of the nation, possibly destabilizing it, but it would also reduce its administrative maintenance cost, allowing it to grow bigger.

#idea_vegettan#1
Using tannins

#idea_vegettan_1#1
One autumn, a busy and inexperienced tanner had left and forgotten a stack of cleaned hides outside near his house, under a grove of trees. The hides remained there for weeks and hadn't been properly packed: they soaked with water from the humid ground and constant rains of autumn, covered and surrounded by fallen twigs and leaves from the nearby trees. When the tanner realized his mistake, he was quite surprised to find the hides in such good condition: not only had they resisted putrefaction from the humidity, but they looked more flexible than the ones usually processed through drying and smoking. What was the cause of this miracle? Looking at the brown water from the decaying leaves and wood in which the hides had soaked all that time, the tanner felt he already knew the answer to that.

#idea_ventshaft#1
Digging deeper

#idea_ventshaft_1#1
The deeper our mining tunnels go, the hotter it gets and the less air there is for the miners. By creating a system of air shafts and planned ventilation, we could improve the conditions and efficiency of our underground mines, allowing them to go deeper and exploit more ores.

#idea_verneer#1
Gluing layers of wood

#idea_verneer_1#1
Instead of building with solid wood that can be prone to warping and splitting, we could develop a new technique called veneering where thin layers of wood are glue together, wich would make the end result stronger than natural wood while the apparant layer could be selected for its cosmetic properties, looking as good as plain wood while consuming less material.

#idea_warehous#1
Improving storage

#idea_warehous_1#1
We could improve the storage of common resources by building a proper warehouse with employees to help managing and moving its inventory. This would allow us to store more goods on smaller surfaces.

#idea_warham#1
Countering steel armors

#idea_warham_1#1
As enemies now face us with armors stronger than ever made of hardened steel, blades tend to ricochet on their surface. We need a new weapon able to deliver blows with full force that no metallic armor would be able to withstand: some weaponsmiths propose to create thin hammers mounted on long poles that could inflict damage even without piercing the armor itself but simply by the force of impact!

#idea_watres#1
Stocking water

#idea_watres_1#1
We should learn how to build and maintain large reservoirs of fresh water for periods of need.

#idea_weaving#1
Crafting skins of vegetals

#idea_weaving_1#1
Sometimes peeling tree barks or long grass gives you long strips of vegetables that can be dried and woven into baskets and other things by the craftmen of the tribe. But these are usually hard and rough. Yet some of them compete to always produce the finest weaving with the softest thread, experimenting with new techniques and new materials. What if they managed to make a material thin, flexible and light enough to use instead of the smelly leather hides we use for clothing? 

#idea_well#1
Water in the ground

#idea_well_1#1
There is water underground. We need to find out how to dig and maintain holes to access it so we can get new sources of fresh water.

#idea_wheel#1
It spins!

#idea_wheel_1#1
Trunks can roll, making them easier to move around. But they're too long... what if we cut one into a shorter slice and found a way to attach things to it while it spins ? We could move stuff around in a much easier way!

#idea_wine#1
In vino veritas

#idea_wine_1#1
These red tasty grapes, when pressed into a juice and left to spoil for a long time turns into an intoxicating strong beverage that alter the senses and the consciousness, making Porcos reveal their true self and lifting their spirits. This beverage must be a gift from the gods, we need to master it's making.

#idea_yeast#1
Fluffier bread

#idea_yeast_1#1
Bread dough that's been left over for a while then tastes and reacts differently when cooked. Sometimes it makes the whole bread inflate and taste better, sometimes it makes it disgusting, moldy and bitter. Noone know by what mysteries this happens, but some bakers noticed that by keeping a sample of good dough to mix with the fresh one of the next batch, you could achieve consistency and get the same flavor and fluffyness. This new technique would improve our break making.

#proj_academ_1#1
For the prosperity and cultural excellence of our people, we could create a place of knowledge and wisdom, with our most sagacious pigs working to furtger our knowledges of the world.

#proj_agrcultr_1#1
We could try to make our own plants instead of relying on the naturally existing ones. To do this, one pocro proposes to create a large patch of mud near the village and sacrifice some of our harvested foods to burry it in that ground, claiming this will bring new plants we can harvest later! But how long will this take ? How much work ? Can we afford to sacrifice food for such a foolish enterprise ?

#proj_airblstl_1#1
idea_airblstl_1

#proj_alambic_1#1
When you heat and boil water for a long time, it disapears into fumes. When an alcoholic bevarage is heated, it seems that its intoxicating fumes are the strongest at first and leave a tasteless drink behind. What if we could design a device that could collect these first fumes back to separate what makes these drinks so intoxicating from the tasteless water? Some think it could be possible by trapping and cooling the fumes which would turn back into a liquid.

#proj_algebr_1#1
We need a language for numbers, a standardized system of symbols with rules that represent operations and calculations.

#proj_animcaptr_1#1
Sometimes, hunters manage to capture preys unharmed, or they find youngsters that remained alone. Other times, some herbivor animals come wandering near the village seemingly indifferent to our presence. What if we built walls around them to keep them near the village for times of need? This way if the hunters fail to catch anything, we can still have fresh meat for the tribe! We would need to learn how to take care of them through the rest of the year though, and some tribe member would need to guard them into pastures to feed. But it would give us the safety of always having fresh food available for our people in case of shortage!

#proj_animdom_1#1
In the wilderness herds grow bigger every year and there is always new animals to hunt! How does that happen ? We know how to take care of the few beasts we captured and keep in paddocks for times of need. But what if we found a way to manage and breed them efficiently like they do in the wilderness? We could produce our own animals without needing to hunt them! But could we manage bigger herds of animals? Feeding them, garding them, managing their breeding and giving birth...

#proj_animhusb_1#1
Not all animals of the same species look the same: some are smaller, others are more friendly, or agressive, or tougher, or faster... What if we decided to only breed the animals with these individual traits we want? Maybe their offspring would share the same traits and we could improve our cattle this way, developping animals specialized into serving our needs and friendlier to us.

#proj_archbdg_1#1
Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of stone to counteract the effects of gravity, but what if we could master a way to create new arches so light they could stand on simple columns by redirecting weight into its supporting pillars ? We could construct things bigger, taller and more spacious than anything we've ever built before.

#proj_archery_1#1
Some wood show exceptionnal flexibility and ability to store tension without breaking. What if we could find a way to project them simply by releasing a bent piece of wood, stronger than any arm can? 

#proj_archives_1#1
Keeping existing and past documents organized and archived can sometimes greatly benefit the efficiency of our administration. We should invest in a governmental archive specialized in organizing and keeping all our administrative documents.

#proj_archtct_1#1
Complex construction require the expertise and skill of sagacious pigs knowledgable in the sciences of numbers and geometry, and not just leave it to mere builders who know how to manipulate a hammer. They could use these sciences to predict and build things noone deems possible, and to research new methods and techniques for the glory of our people. We would call them Architects.

#proj_ard_1#1
Instead of manually working the fields with hoes, what if we devised a way to use animals to pull a bigger one that would break the soil in lines for us, making it ready for the seeds. With such technique we could work much bigger fields and greatly improve the efficiency of farms.

#proj_aritmet_1#1
We could manage amounts more easily by devising a system to organize numbers and how to combine them.

#proj_barrel_1#1
We if by assembling planks together to form a large cylindric container held together with metal, we made a new kind of containers to store liquids? They could use limited space more efficiently for transportation and while a broken amphora is useless, such a wooden container could always be repaired. They could even be dismantled on when empty to be rebuilt on demand! Yes they would be more expensive and require more work and skill to build, but some say they could improve alcoholic beverages preservation while adding new flavors to it.

#proj_barter_1#1
We could start exchanging goods of equivalent values for each service on the instant instead of sharing everything with anyone of the community hoping for later paybacks which becomes harder to track as the population increases: a gift economy can only be viable as long as all members of the community can build trust by knowing and remembering each other. Beyond that it creates much conflict and instability which could be reduced by transitionning to a system of immediate equivalent exchange.

#proj_baskpress_1#1
With the power of screws and the knowledge of how to craft solid barrels, we would surely improve our pressing machines by having the fruits placed in a barrel with enough space between each plank to let the juices out as a plate if forced down into it by the force of a screw! This would increasing greatly their efficiency and require less workforce for the same amount of work.

#proj_baths_1#1
Bathing is such a relaxing activity, but its gets boring alone in your home or inconvenient oustide in the river... What if we made facilities specialized in bathing where Porcos of the city could come to relax in bigger pools of warm water while socializing and enjoying entertainments at the same time? 

#proj_battleaxe_1#1
If axes are good enough to cut trees, they're good enough to cut bacon. We could create special axes designed for combat by making them lighter and longer, with narrower crescent shaped blades to deal high damage! Such a weapon would however require to be manipulated with both hands, but effective even against armored enemies.

#proj_beamprss_1#1
Using the new principle of the lever, we could apply it to improve the way we press hard olives into oil by have a long level apply pressure on a plate while olives are kept in a soft basket of ropes. A few workers could apply great pressure from the other end of the lever, making the process much faster than by using mortars and increasing the production speed of olive oil.

#proj_beastwr_1#1
Some wild animals are fierce and noble. Their hunting ways deserve respect and admiration of our warriors. The spirits of these magestic beasts could infuse strenght in our best porcos to form an elite cast of warriors that would instill fear onto our enemies.

#proj_beer_1#1
Grain left to ferment in water for a long time makes a thick nourishing drink that makes people feel nice and festive. Isnt this a gift from the gods? Some porcos want to specialize in working full time into making this special drink for everyone to enjoy!

#proj_blastfurn_1#1
Building taller and bigger bloomeries while using belows to blow more air directly into its base would allow us to keep improving our furnaces, making them reach much higher temperatures to produce better quality metals and a faster rate. 

#proj_bllws_1#1
The more air, the hotter the furnace gets: instead of relying on natural air flow, we could try to make a device that manually blows air directly into the heart of the furnace, by pressing on a bag filled with air into a pipe which would help us increase further more the temperature and efficiency of our metal working.

#proj_bloomry_1#1
Heating rocks to extract and melt metals is key to process ores quicker and get a better quality result with less impurities. Everyone knows blowing air on fire brings it life and heat. We need to improve our furnaces design to build bigger ones, reusable, with solid materials while finding a way to provide its fire with fresh air which could allow us to reach higher temperatures and make metals more efficiently!

#proj_bread_1#1
In every household, people spend a lot of time every day grinding their grains in mortars to cook their flat breads for each meal. Therefore some propose that by using our knowledges of gears and stonecutting we could create giant mortars that would grind grains for everyone at once and have artisans specialize in cooking breads for everyone in the city directly, saving people from making it themselves out of raw cereals. Grinded grains would also be easier and more convenient to store directly into granaries, improving our ability to store food!

#proj_brigdn_1#1
Scale armors are vulnerable to piercing attacks and upward blows. Despite a slight loss of flexibility, what if instead of having visible scales on top of each other we designed an armor where the scales are sewn indepently to a padded leather cloth and covered by another layer of fabric to hide them, making the whole more resistant to piercing thanks to the leather and the impossibility to slip the point of a weaping through gaps between scales?

#proj_bronze_1#1
Now that we know how to make metals as liquid as water, what would happen if we mixed some together? Maybe we could create some new metals that never exist in nature with better properties? Copper is abundant and usefull, but it is soft and it wears quickly. Maybe we should experiment mixing it with other metals to see if we can improve this?

#proj_builders_1#1
Building things is getting complex and hard, requiring more and more skills. Having people specialized in construction would allow us to build better things and develop more advanced techniques.

#proj_calculus_1#1
By giving geometric objects such as lines,circles and curves representation as algebraic equations, we could study the very idea of 'continuous change' itself.

#proj_carpet_1#1
Wool is so warm and comfy, why not make simple textiles made out of it to cover the floors and walls of our huts with? It would make for nice and warm new furniture everyone would like to have in his home!

#proj_castnet_1#1
Instead of throwing sticks at fishes, why not weave loose flexible baskets we could throw in the water ? The water would pass through while the bigger fishes would remain stuck in it! We need to master this new skill and find the proper way and materials to weave these special baskets... it would make catching fishes much easier and less time consumming!

#proj_cattleliers_1#1
Cattle can spread over large areas and herds can become pretty difficult to manage. Higher up on horseback, it would be more convenient to move around and keep an eye on the herds than walking on foot below! Horses could become the essential companion to cattle raisers, making it easier to pursue and lead larger herds and managing bigger pastures. They would just need to get used to it...

#proj_cementation_1#1
idea_cementation_1

#proj_charcoal_1#1
Sometimes when burning wood, after a large fire, some pieces of wood burn but didnt turn into ashes. They look grey and porous, and after trying to light a new fire with them they appear to burn even hotter than normal wood while producing little smoke and are easier to light. If we could figure out exactly how to make these out of wood, we could use them in our pottery kilns and other industries instead of wood, increasing their efficiency!

#proj_chnmail_1#1
All armors remain weak against piercing blows: the finest weaponsmiths propose to craft a fine cloth of tiny metal rings which, linked together, would form an unpiercable coat that could be worn beneath other armors to protect against arrows and thrusting attacks. Such an armor would be expensive and really time consuming, requiring the best craftsmanship and metal, probably reserved to elite troops.

#proj_cider_1#1
Apples are a nutricious source of food in nordic rainy lands where the nights come early during winters. It can also make for a tasty juice once pressed. But some porcos have started to let it spoil for days before drinking it, claiming it tastes even better and lifts the spirits. If we can master the skill of brewing this new beverage, we could create a new craftsmanship specialized in producing it.

#proj_cloth_1#1
Walking around with our bare piggy skins is not always very comfortable, especially in colder days. The sight of the Sow's multiple udders also seems to distract some of the tribespigs from their daily tasks...

#proj_coing_1#1
The government could apply its seal on metal ingots used by people in trades, to guarantee their quality and create units of standardized weights. That would facilitate exchanges and increase the people's trust in the currencies they're getting in exchange of their goods while giving us full control over the management of these special "coin" ingots.

#proj_coke_1#1
In the same way we make charcoal out of wood, in the ground we found coal: an oily dark kind of stone that, if baked it in a similar fashion turns into coke which can be used as a combustible in the same way we use charcoal. Mastering this process would allow us to get combustible without the need to cut down entire forests!

#proj_compbow_1#1
To allow for mounted archers, we need to design a new type of bow that is shorter while remaining powerful enough to deal significant damage to enemies. Then we need to develop techniques of how to effectively train archers in its use. 

#proj_concrete_1#1
What if we had the power to create stone and shape it as we wish? A liquid plaster that would dry and become harder as stone itself while also resisting water istelf and withstanding the harshness of weather? Such amazing material would allow us to build new things never dreamt before! Some pretend that by mixing lime, gravels and ceramics with a special kind of sand, we could achieve such mixture. Surely this is worth investigating ?

#proj_constrct_1#1
Even skilled builders need someone to coordinate them and take time to plan, organize and manage the construction instead of directly participating. Especially when it comes to building more complex things. These construction foremen would improve our ability to manage more complex construction projects.

#proj_constrplan_1#1
No longer can we keep build randomly individual buildings without any global planning. Construction foremen and the government could work together to build and organize things necessary for the whole community, such as solid roads of stone to make circulation easier in the city, fences, or even modifying the elevation of terrain!

#proj_corbarch_1#1
The post and lintel construction technique has its limits: there's only so much weight a beam can withstand before breaking. What if we could redirect weight on the sides to improve this, by stacking beams of increasing lenght on top of each other until the cover the space between the pillars ?

#proj_council#1
We could reorganize and expand the leadership of our society by adding a council of trusted advisors tasked with assisting and councelling the Leader in governance instead of having him personnaly attend to all issues.

#proj_court_1#1
Developping the project of building a luxurious expensive palace devoted to hosting vassals directly in the capital and pacifying them with a life of luxury and hedonism. This will be extremely costly to maintain, but will make the administration of subordinates considerably easier.

#proj_crossbow_1#1
Designing a new type of mechanical bow that uses leverage and gears to draw and hold a harder metallic bow that can shoot much more powerful arrows while requiring less training for soldiers.

#proj_cuirass_1#1
A warrior with a skin of metal would be undefeatable for sure. And metal can be shaped into anything we want. However its not flexible... But we could still use it as a breastplate protecting most of the body from enemy weapons, although it would be heavy and reduce the dexterity of the warrior wearing it, it could save his life more than once!

#proj_currcy_1#1
We could try to select common goods that are small, durable and rare enough to use as standards for exchanges: anyone could exchange their goods to one of these knowing they can then trade it back against other necessities. That would facilitate trading, not having to find goods needed by both parties and beeing able to measure and store values more efficiently.

#proj_cuves_1#1
With our new knowleges of metallurgy, we could craft larger cuves made of metal sheets to help in the fermenting and brewing of alcohols. This would be a better material than using wood or ceramic pots, and its more convenient to heat and impermeable. Such containers could improve the quality and production of our alcohol industries.

#proj_decarb_1#1
Cast Iron isn't really usefull by itself: it's very strong but also very brittle and you cannot work with it. We can produce it easily but its saturated with carbon... Meanwhile, steel is also iron, but with less carbon in it. Currenlty we are making steel by taking pure iron and adding carbon to it with charcoal but its slower to produce and requires a lot of manual forging to produce while Cast Iron can be mass produced with blast furnaces. Therefore it would make steel production much easier if we could master a way to make steel out of Cast Iron by removing the extra carbon instead of making it by adding carbon to pure iron.

#proj_democrcy_1#1
Organizing a new form of government fit for a City-State where the city is to be considered a public property: it belongs to all its citizens, as opposed to being the private property of a few individuals. The power of property must le limited, and the only legitimate source of power is its people. 

#proj_democrcy_2#1
There can no longer be any formal Leader or priviledged nobility: all the decisions of the city must be taken by direct vote of all its free citizens and decided by the majority, with every citizen's vote counting equally.

#proj_diagnos_1#1
Our bodies are machines that we could study with empiricism to understand how they break and how to fix them. Studying external signs could help doctors understand what broke and where, and what treatment is required.

#proj_domcat_1#1
These capricious feline animals are very usefull to keep rodents away and preserve our food stocks! We should try to tame and domesticate some of them to keep in our village.

#proj_domdog_1#1
Wolves are fierce pack hunters. They run fast and their smell is sharp. Sometimes, some of them come lurking near the village and don't always seem to be agressive. It happens that some porcos throw them some leftovers, and they remain near the village. What if we could befriend these noble animals and have them with us to assist our hunters with their tracking skills and speed ?

#proj_domebdg_1#1
Using our knowledges of arch building and cranes allowing us to build taller structures, what if we tried to combines arches to create an indoor sky, a semi-spherical roof that would allow us to build glorious and impressive monuments with an indoor space so tall and so vast it would feel like having the sky above you! 

#proj_educ_1#1
Teaching our culture, rules, traditions and knowledges to the new generations is important. We could organize a new cast of people specialized in teaching the new generations.

#proj_eldcncl_1#1
A lot of conflicts could be avoided if the elders of each family of the tribe talked with each other more often, for the oldpigs are wise and have the respect of their families. Also it would give them something to do besides pestering the youngsters of the tribe...

#proj_eldcncl_2#1
If we can convince them to talk to each other, which will not be easy, we could build a special large hut for them to meet and talk about issues of the tribe. I am sure the rest of the tribe would abide to their judgements and decisions.

#proj_elephrid#1
Taming pachyderms

#proj_elephrid_1#1
These huge pachyderm beasts have the strenght of 50 hogs. They also seem to be pretty clever: what if we could find a way to tame them and work with them? Imagine the rampage such mighty animals could do into battles if they accepted to fight among us! They surely look strong enough to carry and push heavy weights. Maybe they could even carry people on their backs... It's worth trying!

#proj_engineer_1#1
We need construction masters specialized in solving problems and innovating, producing new techniques and methods by exploiting our knowledges of the sciences.

#proj_ferment_1#1
It seems that leaving sweet fruits or grains in water for a long time in a covered pot makes it transform into something else that tastes funny but feels nice. Maybe that requires more investigating...

#proj_fineryforg_1#1
Iron is a capricious metal hard to work with. If you heat it just enough to soften, with a lot of manual forging you can work it into a maleable but flexible soft metal. However if you melt it completely to the point of casting it, it becomes very hard but brittle and impossible to work with! Blast furnaces are very efficient and fast but they are so efficient they only produce this cast iron we do not know how to work with properly... Heating and hammering it for a long time allows to slowly remove the carbon, eventually producing pure 'rough iron'. Using our knowledges of mechanics, we could try to create special forges making this operation much more faster and efficient, allowing us to streamline iron production out of cast iron ingots we can already mass produce with bast furnaces.

#proj_fishboat_1#1
Many things float on water, such as fallen tree trunks. It's not easy to stand on one though... but if we carved a hole in it, we could fit one or more porcos. Instead of beeing stuck on the coast throwing nets to catch fishes, with such device, fisherpigs could reach more distant fishes and catch them more efficiently!

#proj_foodstor_1#1
By making special storages isolated from the ground, we could improve food storage and its protection against rodents and other vermins.

#proj_forg_1#1
Working with Iron is difficult and requires to keep the metal heated during the whole process. To do this efficiently and in order to master this art, we need to develop and design special furnaces and tools to work this metal.

#proj_furnitr_1#1
Instead of living in mostly empty huts and sleeping on the floor on small mats, some porcos propose to start crafting more refined objects out of woodcarving and metal to use inside homes to replace built in shelves, benches and sleeping bunks. These lighter and mobile furnitures would increase the life quality and comfort of those who can afford them while creating a new craftmanship, growing our economy.

#proj_garden_1#1
Developing the know-how and tradition of arranging decorative gardens where plants and trees are cultivated for their aesthetic rather than their usefulness.

#proj_geometry_1#1
We could improve our surveying and construction by studying the principles of space: lenghts, areas, angles and volumes.

#proj_gillnet_1#1
Most of the times when casting nets on fishes, they remain entangled in the net itself with no need of beeing actually trapped in it. What if we simply made a net 'wall' standing in the water waiting for the fishes to entangle themselves without having to do anything ? We could use floaters one one edge and weights on the opposite one so it would stand vertically in the water and catch all the bigger fishes trying to pass through! Such technique could facilitate the work of fisherpigs and increase their efficiency.

#proj_glaz_1#1
Developing a new method of ceramic glazing based on tin oxide, improving the quality and esthetic of earthenwares by giving them a white and shiny coating.

#proj_glaz_2#1
We should invest time and resources into experimenting and perfecting this new technique, to get more durable and better looking pottery!

#proj_glue_1#1
Animal butchery and fisheries produces many leftovers which have no use. Some propose to experiment what we could do with some of them: tanners noticed that by boiling skins it sometimes produces a sticky jelly that hardens when it cools off. A furniture maker wants to experiment on this idea to see if this could be used as an adhesive substance strong enough to hold pieces of wood together, which could greatly improve the quality and production of fine furnitures.

#proj_goldsmth_1#1
Precious metals are not only rare and visually appealing but also very durable and malleable into any shape it is possible to think of, making them a perfect mateiral to create new artistic pieces of creative jewelry.

#proj_gov_1#1
Reorganizing the leadership of our society by expanding the amount, specialization, and hierachy of civil servants each one with now legally defined responsabilities and acting under the instructions of Ministers mandated by the Leader.

#proj_granary_1#1
Using our new knowledge of arch building, we could build better elevated granaries withstanding heavier loads, allowing us to store more foods in them. 

#proj_grndmining_1#1
There's a limit to how much ore is available directly on the surface. It keeps going underground like rivers of rock, and we have to learn how to follow it. We could start digging tunnels completely underground to follow and exploit the ore!

#proj_guard_1#1
Lets create and organize a new cast directly dependent on the goverment: guards, a new kind of warriors that would protect the government not against foreign ennemies but against our own population. They would protect officals and patrol the city everyday, reinforcing our authority on the population. 

#proj_hallcity_1#1
Developping a new territorial status with more delegated power to the region and more budjet for its administration in order to allow for better management of larger settlements and Countryside territories.

#proj_hallcomn_1#1
Developing the idea of building a communal hall: a building shared by all the people of the tribe and used as a place of meeting and discussion for everyone to better organize the life of the settlement and palliate the growing problems of organizing the growth of the settlement's population.

#proj_halltown_1#1
Organizing a proper local administration with civil servants devoted to management of regionnal affairs, allowing for better management of larger settlements and more Countryside territories.

#proj_helbard_1#1
Some weaponsmiths proposed to build a new versatile pole weapon combining the features of spears and battleaxes into one. With its high reach it could be efficient against other pikes and spears infantry but also against mounted units while beeing also able to cut and slash with its side blade.

#proj_herb_1#1
Nature created many different plants, fruits and roots. If we take time to study their effects, we could get new knowledges on how to cure some of the afflictions our people suffers. 

#proj_hops_1#1
Some brewers propose to replace the mix of herbs and spices used traditionally to balance the sweet malt flavors in beer by a new plant's flower called 'hops'. This heresy is supported by the claim that on top of adding a nice pleasuring flavor to beer, it would also increase its preservation making it storable for a longer time. That's been a major issue of beer making and improving its shelf life would greatly improve the industry's production by reducing waste.

#proj_horsebckrid_1#1
Some animals are strong enough to carry heavy loads on their backs, so why not us? If we can select the most adapted and docile breeds to do so, and how to teach them to obey our orders, we could travel directly on their backs instead of using carts and heavy chariots attached on their backs. It would make travelling on it more practical and fast, and it would open new perspectives for warefare as well!

#proj_hvhelmet_1#1
Why not cover the whole face and sides with metal as well with our helmets? Sure it would reduce the field of vision for our warriors, but it would look sick. It would also improve their armor too...

#proj_hvshield_1#1
What if we made shields larger and tall enough to stand directly on the ground and wide enough for the soldier to be fully protected behind it? It would allow units to withstand heavy charges by taking support on the shields. These heavy items would however slow down troops and limit their movements, reducing their combat skill.

#proj_iron_1#1
What if there is more metals we havn't discovered yet? Some red stones seem to hide a different metal we know nothing off, but that seem to be considerably harder to extract and work with. However making bronze out of Copper and the rarer Tin is a complicated process that makes us rely on 2 different metals and dependent on trade. Maybe this new metal, while harder to extract, could be an alternative to Bronze?

#proj_irrig_1#1
The ground is sometimes too dry for cultivating plants. What if we created our own artificial rivers to carry water into the fields and water their soil ?

#proj_javelin_1#1
Instead of beating beasts and foes with cudgels, some propose to create lighter and balanced pointy sticks of wood that we could throw from a distance with some training. Imagine killing an enemy without even having to get near him! This would be of great support for hunters but also to defend our tribe against pillagers from behind a palissade or on top of a cliff!

#proj_jewelry_1#1
Porcos have been attracted by shiny things and wearing them since the dawn of time. But with a growing community comes and increasing need to better stand out with more unique pieces made with ever increasing craftsmanship and rarer materials.

#proj_jewelry_2#1
To complete this project we will first need to collect precious shells for our artisans to practice on. These are rare and found only on the coast. If we fail to find any, rumors are that Porcoderthal tribes traditionnally hoard them. Hunting these tribes if there is still any roaming nearby could be a good way to get them.

#proj_kiln_1#1
Instead of using temporary one-time-use ovens covered with clay to bake charcoal or pottery, we could try to build bigger solid reusable ovens that would increase the quality and production speed of our baking operations, built with heat resistant bricks. That would benefit our potters but also the production of charcoal!

#proj_lamnrarm_1#1
Designing a new type of armor using the flexibility of iron and steel made of overlapping strips that provide more mobility compared to a solid one-piece breastplate.

#proj_lawmkrs_1#1
Developping a new institution of high officials devoted solely to the discussion and writting of laws.

#proj_laws_1#1
A universal set of laws, defined by the government, would improve the fairness of our society by making sure everyone is suject to the same rules!

#proj_lead_1#1
Its time for the tribe to be lead by a single Porco. One pig to rule them all, without all the talking and negociating and convincing everyone to do anything. But this will not be easy, and all the other key members of the village must give their support, be submitted or be eliminated. Then, finally, only you will control the fate of the tribe!

#proj_lever_1#1
Using the principles of mathematics and geometry, some pretend we could have a single Porco exert the force of 10. What kind of sorcery would that be? If this where to be possible, we could have move and uplift weights that would normally require a tremendous amount of workers with only a few!

#proj_lhelmet_1#1
Most fatal blows for warriors are to the head. With our new knowledge of metallurgy we can shape something solid into anything we want. We should make hats made of hard metal, that would greatly improve the protection of our warriors.

#proj_longbow_1#1
Trying to design larger more powerful infantry bow that can be produced at low cost out of wood and developping the demanding training techniques required to master it. 

#proj_longsword_1#1
Using our new forging techniques, we could now attempt to create longer and lighter swords. Such formidable weapons would require 2 hands to be manipulated, forbidding the ability to combine it with shields, but a skilled warrior would be unstopable and nothing would be able to withstand its blows!

#proj_loom2_1#1
Instead of manually weaving cloth which takes a very long time, maybe we could build some sort of structure helping the artisans in the process of weaving and sorting all the different threads required. That could really increase the speed at which our weavers can produce textile!

#proj_loom3_1#1
Vetical warp-weighted looms are primitive and impractical to use. With the increased experience of our weavers and our better woodworking tools, some propose to research an improved new design of handlooms that would increase their productivity and comfort.

#proj_loom4_1#1
Using our new knoweldges of pulleys, we could apply such mechanics to create bigger and better looms with new automated functions using a clever system of levers, pulleys and foot-treadles. These much bigger looms would increase the production and quality of all our weavers.

#proj_loom5_1#1
The 'shuttle' is a piece of the loom that needs to go from one side of the textile to the other constantly. Its a fastidious and tiring operation for the weaver, requiring to constantly bend over the machine to move the shuttle, and it limits the size of the woven textile to his arm's lenght or it requires complex coordination between multiple workers. If we could find a way to improve this process with mechanics, it could greatly improve the productivity of our textile industries and the working conditions of our weavers.

#proj_loom6_1#1
proj_loom6_1

#proj_manure_1#1
Knowing the benefits of animal manure as a fertilizer, and how animal husbandry can work in synergy with agriculture to improve production.

#proj_market_1#1
To facilitate exchanges with other foreign cities, we could create a special place for traders to gather and store goods meants to be exported. These specialized traders would continuously travel and keep contact with other cities to know what they have to buy and sell at which prices. This would allow us to directly buy and sell resources with our partner cities with currency.

#proj_marriag_1#1
Arranging marriages between ruling families is a good way to seal an alliance and unite tribes by blood.

#proj_masonry_1#1
Mastering the technique of building with bricks and mortar would allow us to greatly improve our building techniques, making structures taller, lighter, and more solid. But most of all the use of a standardized material facililtates its production and storage while speeding up the actual construction.

#proj_metalrgy_1#1
Jewelry makers have discovered some shiny yellow stones sometimes seen glistering in the bed of nearby rivers: these are very precious and rare. They are unusually heavy, they reflect the sun, and unlike ordinary brittle stones they are malleable and can be hammered to take different shapes!

#proj_metalrgy_2#1
These would make very desirable pieces of adornmants and they want to organize an expedition to search and collect them from the rivers where they've been spotted. 

#proj_metcast_1#1
Metals become soft and maleable when heated in large fires. The hotter, the more maleable and soft they seem to become... So what if we improved our furnaces to heat them so much they would become temporarly as liquid as fresh water? We could litteraly pour the metal into holes with the desired shape right away instead of having to work it with manual hammering. If we can master this technique, that would allow us to mass produce items and weapons at a much higher speed and with a much more consistent quality!

#proj_metrolog_1#1
The ability to measure alone is insufficient; standardisation is crucial for measurements to be meaningful. We need to create units of measurements for distances, weights and volumes.

#proj_metshield_1#1
We could produce stronger but heavier shields by adding a metal sheet on their surface on top of wood, if we can master the proper way to do this.

#proj_miningtl_1#1
Using our new knowledges of metallurgy we can now produce better tools. Its time to design proper tools specialized into mining operations, which would greatly improve the speed of ore extraction instead of simply relying on lighting fires waiting for the rock to crack!

#proj_mudbdg_1#1
Sometimes mud dries under the sun and becomes really hard and solid. What if we used mud to cover and isolate our huts ? We could maker bigger and more solid huts just out of dirt!

#proj_mudbrick_1#1
What if we find a way to make solid cubes out of mud, using just dirt and water? That would allow us to build a lot of things out of nothing but dirt!

#proj_multistor_1#1
With all our current architectural knowledges, we should be able to master new techniques and expertise to build taller structures with multiple floors. This could allow us to house more people in places where ground space is limited!

#proj_obsidn_1#1
Obsidian is volcanic glass that is easy to work and very hard: it can break into extremely sharp angles which could be turned into weapons sharper than anything made out of regular flints. We could invest time and resources to have people of the tribe master the skill of working it and to design weapons out of it.

#proj_oliveoil_1#1
On knotted trunk trees grow small berries some porco enjoy to eat. That is until someone had the idea to squeeze them to get juice out of it... it produces an oily liquid that tastes really nice with other foods, and that can also have many other uses such as a snout skin care product or to keep a shiny pig furr. We should learn to cultivate these trees and how to efficiently press its berries to start producing more of this precious oil.

#proj_orecrush_1#1
Using our new knowledges of engineering and gears, we could improve the labour intensive process of crushing ores into smaller stones which is required to process them and make them ready for efficient smelting. Using a mill and mechanisms, ore crushing could be vastly improved, freeing workforce to help making our mines more efficient.

#proj_packanim_1#1
Animals are stronger than people. If we could get some to carry bags on their backs, it would greatly improve our ability to move cargo between territories.

#proj_paddarm_1#1
Leather is well resistant to cutting, but not really efficient in cushionning blows. Some artisans propose to create a thicker type of armor designed to cushion enemy blows by using cotton and 'quilting': sewing several layers of fabric together. They claim such armor, even by itself, could prove far more efficient than expected while only using cheap materials. It could also be used in addition to other types of armor worn above it.

#proj_paparmor_1#1
proj_paparmor_1

#proj_paper_1#1
Wood is abundant and readily available. It is possible to write on tablets of wood, but it is heavy and hard to transport or store... But maybe we could try to find a way to grind it into a paste and dry it into fine sheets we could store and carry more easily!

#proj_philo_1#1
What is real? Do we have free will? What is the best way to live? 

#proj_phonetic_1#1
Instead of having one sign for each object or idea, we could have signs that represent sounds... similar to how people speak. This way, with fewer signs we could writte everything as we speak! This would make writting much faster and easier to learn and transmit.

#proj_pickaxe_1#1
Using steel, we could now produce a tool harder than most stones. If we can design such a tool, using it in our mines would greatly increase the efficiency of all our miners!

#proj_pictgrm_1#1
We could create more signs to represents more and more objects, but also actions and ideas! We could start writting about stories and events, saving the history of our people instead of just using it to keep track of transactions, payments and debts.

#proj_plantselect_1#1
What if by keeping the plants that gave the best results and replanting only those, we could improve the whole production ? This is probably going to take a while, but if we keep doing this our cultures could greatly improve!

#proj_platearm_1#1
Designing a new type of armor made of hand-forged and custom-made steel plates, offering a full body protection to its wearer.

#proj_plough_1#1
Instead of simply scratching the soil with an ard we could build a modified version of it that would not only dig deeper but also turn the soil upside down, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. This would improve the homogeneity of the soil as well as improving its fertility, increasing the efficiency of our farms further more! 

#proj_portage_1#1
We could have people specialized in carrying goods between territories, who would ensure a constant transfer of resources making sure it never runs out, instead of relying on manual one-time caravans.

#proj_postal_1#1
Organizing and planning a network of postal relays to improve communication speed between our different regions. Each relay would maintain fresh mounts and messengers ready to depart as soon as another one arrives, ensuring that documents arrive in a reccord time and never remain still for a minut until arrived at destination.

#proj_prefects_1#1
Creation of a new high government official: Prefects. They will act directly in behalf of our authority and be sent to administer subordinate States to ensure they uphold their duties national duties.

#proj_privl_1#1
Displaying wealth would be a good way to impress and gain dominance on possible rivals, showing  to everyone that you are fit to rule them because you are not like anyone else: you are their superior. 

#proj_privl_2#1
Yes, they should all aknowledge your superiority by giving  you a share of their wealth! Now though, the rest of the tribe remains to be convinced of this groundbreaking concept...

#proj_prprt_1#1
Many people of the tribe are resenting having to share all their things with each other and its creating tensions. 

#proj_prprt_2#1
To solve these conflicts, we could try to convince all the families of the tribe to accept this simple rule: members of one family are no longer allowed to take things from another family without their approval.

#proj_ptrwhl_1#1
Improving the quality and protection speed of potters by designing a simple mechanism allowing for the worktop to quickly rotate on itself in order to shape potteries not by stacking coils, but by simple rotation.

#proj_ptry1_1#1
Let's try to make baskets of mud, and to find out how to dry them properly so that they don't crumble away in a few days.

#proj_ptry1_2#1
These baskets could be much easier and faster to make. More hermetic than the woven ones, it would help the tribe store things!

#proj_ptry1_3#1
We need some tribespigs to gather some of this special mud and learn how to shape it in baskets and how to put them in fire so it hardens.

#proj_puddlngforg_1#1
puddlngforg_1

#proj_pulley_1#1
Using the principle of the lever and combining it with wheels and ropes, we could create a new simple machine that allows us to lift heavy weights vertically and in a much simplier, space efficient, and convenient way than using levers.

#proj_quarr_1#1
We could improve the extraction of stone blocks by using pulleys and building wooden scaffoldings against the rock. 

#proj_quarrhv_1#1
Using the mechanics of the treadwheel crane allowing us to move and lift heavier weight easily, we could improve the efficiency of our quarrying operations.

#proj_regadmin_1#1
Organizing a dividision of territories in multiple administrative regions instead of centralizing everything around a single city. This will allow us to grow bigger with a territory composed of multiple cities each one with its own regionnal authority ruling over its local territories.

#proj_republic_1#1
Organizing a new form of government where Leaders draw their legitimacy from the people and are meant to rule only in its name and not for private interests. They do not own the country, but are only entrusted with the responsabilities of leading it for the interests of its people, including minorities, thus rejecting the "tyranny of the majority" of direct democracy.

#proj_rotgraz_1#1
The idea would be to have herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. It might feel like a waste of space and resources, but resting grazed lands could allow the vegetation to renew and rebuild while providing younger tender plant stems of better quality for the grazers when they're back, giving them more nutricious food than if it had been continuously exploited. We just need to sort out the proper way to organize the rotation of pastures in the most efficient way possible and how to manage moving the animals.

#proj_rum_1#1
In the woods grow a special kind of thin wood that smells and tastes really nice and sweet. It wasnt long before some experimented extracting juice out of it to make a tasty beverage out of it. But after experimenting with a few pots that had been left out for too long in the heat, some Porcos noticed how different it tasted, and how much more intoxicating it was. We should experiment more with this special wood and find a way to reproduce and improve these tasty beverages that make Porcos feel happier.

#proj_runwat_1#1
What if, in the same way we irrigate fields, we would create small water canals delivering fresh water directly to every home in the city so the people no longer need to get it themselves at the well ?

#proj_scalearm_1#1
Metal is hard and resistent. What if our warrior could wear clothes made of metal to resist enemy blows? Unfortunately its not exactly flexible like cloth... What if, like the scales of the fish, we made a metallic skin made of small scales covering each other, still allowing its wearer to move while beeing heavily protected?

#proj_seal_1#1
Adopting the usage of stamps and seals to authenticate the origin of administrative documents, making it more difficult to fasificate them and improving the efficiency of governance.

#proj_sedent_1#1
What if we decided to settle for good an remain in the same territory ? We could cumulate more things and more tools by not having to worry about having enough tribe's pigs to carry everything everytime we move!

#proj_sewers_1#1
Developping design and techniques to build an underground canal system to carry waste out of the city.

#proj_shield_1#1
To protect ourselves in hand to hand combat or against enemies throwing javelins, arrows, we could try to craft light armors of wood and strong leather that soldiers would carry on one arm to counter blows.

#proj_sledge_1#1
Using wooden sledges sliding on greased rails, we could easily move really heavy things such as stone, improving the efficiency and speed of our builders.

#proj_smelt_1#1
Some metals appear to be hidden and invisible inside regular rocks that look nowhere near them. But they seem to be there, mixed inside the rocks themselves: by placing these rocks in large fire, we can reveal them. If we can master how to make larger and hotter fires, we could extract these metals from rocks at a much faster rate!

#proj_soilcol_1#1
Organizing the collection of swine waste to be used as fertilizer in agriculture.

#proj_spear_1#1
With our new knowledge of metallurgy, we could now craft better spears ending with a stronger metallic head instead of simple sharpenned wooden sticks allowing to fight enemies in hand to hand combat while keeping it distant.

#proj_sprfish_1#1
Strange animals live in the water. Tasty ones, if we managed to catch them for they move too swiftly for our piggy hands. Maybe we could throw sticks like we hunt beasts in the wilderness to catch them, if we can master this skill!

#proj_stdprtmnt_1#1
Creating additionnal State departments filled with paper pushers specialized on various aspects of the administration to manage the growing bureaucratic needs of our government. Bureaucracy will increase inefficiency and waste, but we can keep throwing as much resources as we want to hire more and more civil servants to meet our government's administrative needs.

#proj_steel_1#1
It appears that iron heated in contact with charcoal gets stronger but also more brittle. Too much of it and it becomes useless... But if we were to master the art of dosing and it properly and a process of how to apply it to iron, we could produce a metal far superior than everything we've ever seen so far: steel, at the right balance between flexibility and resistance.

#proj_stlshld_1#1
Steel is stronger, lighter and more flexible than any other metals we've ever had. We could use it to improve our shields for our elite units, combining lightweightness and resistance by reinforcing wood and leather with a thin sheet of steel.

#proj_stonebdg_1#1
Stone is solid and available everywhere. If we could master the technique to make buildings by stacking them together, we could improve our constructions and make great things.

#proj_stonecut_1#1
Instead of assembling and stacking random stones of various size and shapes, we should master the technique of shapping and cutting them into cubes like bricks, using our new tools of metal. It would allow to construct things more easily, more solid, and more efficiently.

#proj_storhaul_1#1
We could try to train and domesticate animals into pulling heavy weights on wheeled carts, which could improve our warehouses by facilitating their management and allowing to store heavier bulks of goods.

#proj_storheav_1#1
Using pulleys and tradewheel cranes, we can lift and move heavier weights. Applying these to warehouses we could store even bigger bulks of goods on small spaces while still beeing able to manage and move them.

#proj_sword_1#1
What if instead of fixing a knife at the end of a stick, we made a knife with a blade long enough that you could use it directly into battle? What used to be impossible with mere stone tools now is with metal. It's heavier than wood, but its also more resistent. Sure it wouldnt be as long as a spear, but it would be able to cut enemies at any point of it lenght while still beeing able to thrust like a spear. This would open up more fighting techniques for skilled soldiers and would make for a great melee weapon, lighter and less encumbrant than spears. 

#proj_tanning_1#1
Animal hides are smelly and they decay, harden, and rot pretty quickly. We need to find ways to improve their durability by preventing their putrefaction. To do that we should master the proper way to clean and process the hides: removing hair, scrapping all the leftover flesh, and drying them with smoke and sun in the same way we smoke meat to make it last longer.

#proj_tax_1#1
Designing a better taxing system would improve the efficiency of our Tax collectors.

#proj_taxation_1#1
Developping a new taxation system based on the population coins incomes and sales.

#proj_territcntrl_1#1
Organizing patrols allowing us to claim and monitor territories surrounding our village, reserving them for future use.

#proj_tradewg_1#1
Instead of puting a few bags on the back of some animaks, we could try to get them to pull big chariots that could carry much more cargo.

#proj_transac_1#1
We could try to create a system of making marks with special meanings on things like clay to keep track of transactions and payments, to make sure nothing gets forgotten and that everyone does what they're supposed to.

#proj_trbtries_1#1
Developping the practice of taking the sons of defeated Leaders as tributaries in order to keep unwillingly vassals in line. Tributaries will live in our city and be educated in our ways to improve their future loyalty while also serving as a deterrent for current leaders to attempt any rebellion against us.

#proj_trdwheelcr_1#1
Using our knowledge of mechanics, what if instead of relying on simple levers and pulleys installed when we need them we tried to design and build a machine specialized in moving, rotating and lifting weights, improving further more the speed and capacity to move things using only a few workers? Such machine could improve our capacity to build more impressive monuments or help improve our storage and docks!

#proj_treasury_1#1
Organizing the creation of a Treasury: a separated office employing scribes only dedicated to the management of finances and serving as intermediaries between the Leader and all the daily expenses management required to run the city. Of course, officially all of it would remain the property of the Leader, but in practice if will give more leeway for experienced scribes to take financial decisions that will improve the administration of the city at the cost of reducing the personnal power of the Leader.

#proj_treaties_1#1
Developping the practice of formally writting all agreements with foreign states, allowing us to conclude deals of much greater complexity with terms described in great details. This will reduce the risks of future misunderstandings and make it harder for any party to deny the agreed terms of the treaty.

#proj_tribut_1#1
Instead of relying on voluntary contributions from the people, its time to set rules and force everyone to give their share for the common good of everyone... to us in the government of course.

#proj_urunhair_1#1
Removing the hair out of the hides is a really labor intensive process that requires a lot of time but is necessary to process the hides into more durable leather. But some tanners with questionnable hobbies advanced that by using urine and soaking the hides for a long time in it makes the hair removing much easier afterwards. This nasty process could greatly improve the efficiency of our tanneries, but its definilty not going to improve the problem of their pestilence...

#proj_vassals_1#1
The adoption of a social code of conduct and laws allowing for a more decentralized hierarchy where every ruler can pledge loyalty and fielty to a liedge as a vassal, often fulfilling obligations of taxation and military participation in return for protection. This new approach to hierarchy will allow any member of a nation to control its own subordinates rather than having everything centralized under the nation leader.

#proj_vegettan_1#1
It seems that by soaking hides for a long time in baths of diluted vegetables and wood, we could improve their flexibility and resistance to humidity, increasing their durability and replacing the older less efficient process of letting them rot and smoking them.

#proj_ventshaft_1#1
The deeper our mining tunnels go, the hotter it gets and the less air there is for the miners. By creating a system of air shafts and planned ventilation, we could improve the conditions and efficiency of our underground mines, allowing them to go deeper and exploit more ores.

#proj_verneer_1#1
Instead of building with solid wood that can be prone to warping and splitting, we could develop a new technique called veneering where thin layers of wood are glue together, wich would make the end result stronger than natural wood while the apparant layer could be selected for its cosmetic properties, looking as good as plain wood while consuming less material.

#proj_warehous_1#1
We could improve the storage of common resources by building a proper warehouse with employees to help managing and moving its inventory. This would allow us to store more goods on smaller surfaces.

#proj_warham_1#1
As enemies now face us with armors stronger than ever made of hardened steel, blades tend to ricochet on their surface. We need a new weapon able to deliver blows with full force that no metallic armor would be able to withstand: some weaponsmiths propose to create thin hammers mounted on long poles that could inflict damage even without piercing the armor itself but simply by the force of impact!

#proj_watres_1#1
We should learn how to build and maintain large reservoirs of fresh water for periods of need.

Sometimes peeling tree barks or long grass gives you long strips of vegetables that can be dried and woven into baskets and other things by the craftmen of the tribe. But these are usually hard and rough. Yet some of them compete to always produce the finest weaving with the softest thread, experimenting with new techniques and new materials. What if they managed to make a material thin, flexible and light enough to use instead of the smelly leather hides we use for clothing?

Trunks can roll, making them easier to move around. But they're too long... what if we cut one into a shorter slice and found a way to attach things to it while it spins ? We could move stuff around in a much easier way!

These red tasty grapes, when pressed into a juice and left to spoil for a long time turns into an intoxicating strong beverage that alter the senses and the consciousness, making Porcos reveal their true self and lifting their spirits. This beverage must be a gift from the gods, we need to master it's making.

Bread dough that's been left over for a while then tastes and reacts differently when cooked. Sometimes it makes the whole bread inflate and taste better, sometimes it makes it disgusting, moldy and bitter. Noone know by what mysteries this happens, but some bakers noticed that by keeping a sample of good dough to mix with the fresh one of the next batch, you could achieve consistency and get the same flavor and fluffyness. This new technique would improve our break making.
