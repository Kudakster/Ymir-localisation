#msn_200pop#1
Tribal craftsmanship

#msn_200pop_1#1
As your newly sendentarized people is no longer burdened by the need to remain mobile and to carry all its properties, it opens the way for the ownership of increased material wealth and the development of new material comforts to take better advantage of this new lifestyle. 

#msn_200pop_2#1
As the tribe's size grows, more people means more worforce available to develop these new skills and knowledges.

#msn_200pop_o_1#1
Mastering new skills

#msn_200pop_o_2#1
Increase your population and develop Pottery and Clothing craftsmanships.

#msn_agri#1
Thriving agriculture

#msn_agri_1#1
Agriculture is the foundatiion of civilization and the true establishment of a sedentary lifestyle. 

#msn_agri_o_1#1
Developping agriculture

#msn_agri_o_2#1
Develop the agriculture in your village by building granaries to store food more efficiencly, planting fields, and aquiring animal husbandry.

#msn_animbreed#1
Gathering an emergency livestock

#msn_animbreed_1#1
Hunters may not always be able to find migrating herds to feed everyone.

#msn_animbreed_2#1
With our hunters now familiar with the techniques of capturing live animals instead of killing them, we have to prepare guarded paddocks and send expeditions exclusively to capture herd animals so we can bring enough of them back alive in the village. 

#msn_animbreed_o_1#1
Capture animals

#msn_animbreed_o_2#1
Build paddocks and send hunters to do capture actions on nearby herds to fill them.

#msn_barter#1
Barter economy

#msn_barter_1#1
To keep developing our growing society, we need to transition from the gift economy to barter in order to stabilize our growing population. While a gift economy is fine for a small tribe, once the population increases beyond the capacity of each individual to know and remember everyone else, a more immediate system of exchange is required as they can no longer keep track of who did what. Without it, conflicts will rise quickly and our society will destabalise!

#msn_barter_2#1
Transitionning to a barter economy is a significant change. You will now have to manage a treasury balance and resources will no longer be free to use: they will have to be purchased from those who own it. Consummables like food will no longer be auto-distributed and directly available to the population: they will now need to be made available to buy from merchants or market stands (a building annex).

#msn_barter_o_1#1
Transition from gift economy to barter economy

#msn_barter_o_2#1
Pass the "Fair exchange" policy, in the government menu's economic tab.

#msn_chiefhut#1
A hut for the Chief

#msn_chiefhut_1#1
Now that you have eliminated your initial opponants and taken undisputed leadership of the tribe, it is time to make it concrete by building a luxuous Chief's hut worthy of your new status where ruling your people can be properly managed and organized.

#msn_chiefhut_2#1
Once the hut is ready and your leadership effective, you will also need to face a new challenge: retaining the favors of the other powerful influent porcos of the tribe, as one cannot simply rule alone... These are known as 'Oligarchs', and a simple way to ensure their continuous support is to buy it with gifts and other offerings such as assigning them servants from community work.

#msn_chiefhut_o_1#1
Establishing your government

#msn_chiefhut_o_2#1
Build the Chief's hut and enact the Leadership policy. Then enable the Political bribes policy with significant gifts to secure the support of Oligarchs and maintain a positive Legitimacy.

#msn_devmetl#1
The Copper age

#msn_devmetl_1#1
With the new discovery of these strange malleable rocks we now call 'metal', a new age is upon us. They can be used to make much better tools and hammered into shapes impossible to achieve with ordinary brittle stones.

#msn_devmetl_o_1#1
Developping metallugry

#msn_devmetl_o_2#1
Secure a source of copper ore and scale up the production of Copper with smelting camps and a steady production of new Axes by tool makers.

#msn_exp#1
Tribal expansion

#msn_exp_1#1
With the leadership within ou tribe now established, it is time to consider expanding to new territories so that our people can grow further and access more resources and control more lands.

#msn_exp_2#1
If they are sucessful, they can start exploiting land around the village and our people will grow bigger and more powerful. 

#msn_exp_o_1#1
Controlling Countryside territories

#msn_exp_o_2#1
Select an empty territory close from your village and fit for a new settlement. Create a new "Settlers" formation and load them with food, tools and materials before ordering them to settle on this new territory.

#msn_frstform#1
First explorers

#msn_frstform_1#1
Now that our population is growing, we should think about forming a group to go explore our surroundings. For this we should gather a group of at least 10 warriors of the tribe and get them ready to move out of the village!

#msn_frstform_2#1
Unlike the 'militia', troops recruited in a regular army are actually removed from your population and become permanent members of the formation. If disbanded, they will return to the territory's population. Unlike the militia, an army can move to other territories, explore the map and perform actions like attacks, hunting, or carrying resources in its inventory. 

#msn_frstform_3#1
Each formation has a 'home' territory which is by default the place where it was created. The home territory is the territory that 'supports' the formation representing the fact its units will need to be replaced as they grow old as time passes. Each territory can support a certain amount of troops for free before having its demography negatively impacted. You can check this value in the Territory Menu.

#msn_frstform_o_1#1
Create your first army

#msn_frstform_o_2#1
Create a new formation of the 'army' type. Place their encampment and recruit at least 10 warriors into it.

#msn_frsthnt#1
First hunt

#msn_frsthnt_1#1
Hunting moving herds brings much more meat and resources than hunting local game. We should organize our first hunt by assembling the Porcos of our tribe and sending them into an expedition in the nearby territories to locate and hunt a herd. This will bring great bounty to our tribe, and help it grow faster and stronger!

#msn_frsthnt_o_1#1
Successfully complete a Hunt

#msn_frsthnt_o_2#1
Locate a herd in nearby territories and successfully complete a 'hunt' action using a formation of warriors and carriers.

#msn_houses#1
Build your first houses

#msn_houses_1#1
Now that we have Sedentism, we can build our first permanent dwellings : primitive rustic huts.

#msn_houses_2#1
Proper housing provides bonuses to life quality and health to the households residing in it, which will help increase our total population by reducing sickness and increasing their will to have piglets. Once empty housing is available, the population will slowly abandon the makeshift tents they currently reside in to move into their new dwellings. However, if the population grows bigger and not enough houses are available, the extra families will be forced to move into makeshift dwellings again and Slums will spawn around your city until you resolve the issue. Slums provide no life quality and lowers the health of its residents, reducing your population's growth.

#msn_houses_o_1#1
Building your first houses

#msn_houses_o_2#1
In the building tab, select the rustic house building and place at least 10 of them.

#msn_ldrship#2
Becoming the Chieftain

#msn_ldrship_1#1
The tribe is currently led informally by various influent members of different famillies in the community without any form of official hierarchy, leading to constant shifts of power and generating many conflicts. Such form of organic governance becomes increasingly unstable as the size of the comunity increases, and the need for a more organized and official leadership becomes a growing necessity. 

#msn_ldrship_2#1
Establishing your undisputed leadership over your people will not be easy. Ruling requires strenght and you will need better warriors to secure your rule and crush any attempt from opponents. But strength alone isn't enough, and you will need to persuade other influent members of the tribe to support your claim and and pledge loyalty and obedience to your family. Surely, not everyone will agree to this and you must prepare to face unrest once your coup is initiated.

#msn_ldrship_fx#2
You will be ready to launch your coup.

#msn_ldrship_o_1#2
Mustering support

#msn_ldrship_o_2#1
Gift jewelry and comfortable huts to gain the support and loyalty of influent tribe members while preparing new warriors to crush the opposition. 

#msn_ldrship_strt#1
Taking power!

#msn_ldrship_strt_1#1
You have now secured the support of all the key influent members of the tribe that you could get to back you through bribes and favors. More loyal warriors have also been recruited to crush any opposition. Everything is now in place to launch you coup and become the undisputed leader of the tribe, securing your position as its new Chieftain.

#msn_ldrship_strt_2#1
However, not everyone will support your claim. Prepare for opponents who will surely take arms against you when you make your move, and only launch your coup once you are ready!

#msn_ldrship_strt_c1#1
Launch your coup!

#msn_ldrship_strt_fx#2
Will trigger an immediate attack from your opponents in the village of 20 Warriors and 10 Javelineers.

#msn_palentfrg#1
The 7 artefacts from the sky

#msn_palentfrg_o_1#1
Find all the 7 Palentir fragements and retreive them in your capital city.

#msn_palentfrg_o_2#1
The palentir fragements are squattered across the world and can be claimed by any formation. Controlling one fragment allows you to see the location of all other fragments. Gain control of all 7 and bring them into your capital to reassemble the Palentir stone and unlock a great power.

#msn1#1
Creating a first settlement

#msn1_1#1
Greetings, [x].

#msn1_2#1
After living as nomads since the dawn of time, living off hunting and gathering, your primitive tribe has finally stumbled upon a territory that seems worthy in which to renounce their nomadic ways. The time has come to settle down and build something significant to stand the test of time and they have chosen you to lead them.

#msn1_3#1
This seems to be a decent territory to do so, but maybe it's worth continuing your journey to find better lands (not advised for new players). The decision is yours.

#msn1_o_1#1
Settle your tribe in a territory

#msn1_o_2#1
Select your tribe formation in the world map, click on the 'orders' button in its menu (bottom-left) and then select the order 'settle' to create a new settlement.

#msn2#1
Water for the tribe

#msn2_1#1
Our newly settled tribe now urgently needs fresh water to survive!

#msn2_2#1
We have to arrange for a spot where the people of the tribe can easily access and get fresh water. No need to worry about it after you place it: the people of the tribe will use it by themselves to get the water they need.

#msn2_3#1
We'll have to watch out though: while one is enough for our small tribe, these spots can only accomodate a limited amount of people. As the tribe grows, they'll need more spots.

#msn2_o_1#1
Build a water collector on the shore of any source of fresh water.

#msn2_o_2#1
In the building tabs, select the water collector and find a valid spot to place it on the shore of fresh water tiles. This building does not require anything and will automatically produce and distribute some water to the population, satisfying their vital need for water.

#msn3#1
Hunting

#msn3_1#1
Our newly settled tribe will quickly starve if we do not find food.

#msn3_2#1
We need to build a hunting camp near any available source of wild animals we can find in our new territory. This will provide us with fresh meat and leather.

#msn3_o_1#1
Build a hunting camp to hunt naturally present wild animals and produce meat.

#msn3_o_2#1
Go in your newly settled territory. In the building tabs, select the hunting camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for animals and place the hunting camp in range so that it will produce meat.

#msn4#1
Gathering

#msn4_1#1
It seems there are also plants in the territory that produce vegetables and fruits we can harvest to feed the tribe.

#msn4_2#1
We need to build a gathering camp near any available source of wild edible plants we can find in our new territory. 

#msn4_o_1#1
Build a gathering camp to exploit edible plants and produce more food.

#msn4_o_2#1
In your newly settled territory, in the building tab, select the gathering camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for edible plants and place the gathering camp in range so that it will harvest them and produce food.

#msn5#1
Tools

#msn5_1#1
We were only carrying a few stone stools with us. Those are required for pretty much everything and soon we will need new ones if we want to keep developing the tribe! 

#msn5_2#1
We should assign a few porcos to the lengthy task of collecting flint from the gravely grounds around here while others can skillfuly use the flint to craft new stone tools.

#msn5_o_1#1
Build a tool maker and a flint collector to start a production of Hammers.

#msn5_o_2#1
Hammers are the first type of tools. Unlike foods, the population itself doesnt consume or need it, but they are required to build many things.

#msn6#1
Wood

#msn6_1#1
We will also need wood to make things. 

#msn6_2#1
We should assign a few porcos to the task of collecting wood from the trees around us : we'll need it!

#msn6_o_1#1
Build a wood gatherer near some trees to start the production of Wood.

#msn6_o_2#1
Wood, like Hammers, is not a resource consummed directly by the population. But, it is required for many constructions and as a material for some production buildings as well.

#msn7#1
Defending the tribe

#msn7_1#1
There might be hostile barbarians around and other unfriendly tribes. We need to be ready to defend ourselves!

#msn7_2#1
Rockthrowers are porcos simply armed with big rocks to throw at the enemy. They are the earliest range unit available. They are slow and have a really short range, making them pretty useless for anything else but defending behind walls and gates. 

#msn7_3#1
We should create a small wooden fort and then recruit a militia of rockthrowers. Deploy them inside the fort in 'stand ground' mode using the 'strategic tool'. This way they will remain in it during battles and won't try to move to engage the enemy. If enemy warriors attack and try to breach the fort, the rockthrowers will be able to attack them from the other side giving you a defensive advantage. You can also add warriors in case the attackers manage to breach through as the rockthrowers are bad in a melee.

#msn7_o_1#1
Create a militia to defend the tribe.

#msn7_o_2#1
Go to the military tab of your territory and create a new formation of the 'militia' type. Place their encampment and recruit 'rockthrowers' into it. Use the strategic tool de deploy them and set their behaviour to "stand ground", ideally inside a small fort of wooden palissades.

#msn8#1
New ideas and knowledges

#msn8_1#1
Occasionally, Porcos of our tribe will get new ideas about how to improve our society and techniques. Ideas from other tribes might reach us as well. These ideas unlock 'projects' we can complete to unlock and master new knowledge. 

#msn8_2#1
While we cannot directly control the appearance of new ideas - though a population with a high quality of life and intelligence will favor it - we can choose to either invest or not in the projects they unlock. In order to start them, projects need researchers assigned to them and might also need things like resources or money. Depending on the number and intelligence of the researchers and the work required, the project will take some time to be completed. If it's sucessfuly completed it will unlock its rewards, usually including a new knowledge.

#msn8_3#1
Knowledge often enables new buildings, policies, or resources and allows your society to evolve. They require a certain amount of 'knowledge space' - the ability of your society to store knowledge - which you will get only through culture at first: for each 10 points of culture you get 1 point of knowledge space. In early game, the best way to increase your culture is simply to increase your total population.

#msn8_4#1
Our tribe just had one of its first ideas: settling down and becoming sedentary. Let's turn this idea into practice by completing its project!

#msn8_o_1#1
Complete your first project to unlock the knowledge of Sedentism.

#msn8_o_2#1
In the government tab (crown button on the top left of the screen), go to the knowledge tab and select the Sedentism project. Assign researchers to it and start it. Then, wait for it to complete.
